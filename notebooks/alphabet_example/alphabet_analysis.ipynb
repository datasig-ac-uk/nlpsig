But in our setting, we actually want to fit our data to our sample of English words (which we call `english_train`), but then obtain embeddings for our sample of the remaining words (which we call `corpus_sample_df`) - noting that this also contains some English words.\n",

This is not optimal and not clean, but some adjustment to `TextEncoder` will be able. In particular, we can perhaps make changes to the `.tokenize_text()` method (which we will see how to use later) which can take in some external text data. \n",
