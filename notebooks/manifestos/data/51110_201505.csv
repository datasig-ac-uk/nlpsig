"Britain has the wealth and resources to do great things.  We can build an economy that gives everyone their fair share of the world’s sixth-richest economy.  We can create a humane,  caring society that supports everyone’s needs.  And we can be a world leader in tackling the threat of climate change.",NA,NA
"Sadly, our current politics – dominated by a small social group and the power of vested interests - are failing to realise this potential.",NA,NA
"Our manifesto is a bold plan to create a more equal, more democratic society while doing our part to heal the planet,  which has been severely damaged by the effects of an unstable, unsustainable economy.",NA,NA
"The austerity experiment has failed, as it did in the 1930s.  Most people have seen their living standards fall, while the top one perce333nt have increased their wealth. Millions of households are living in poverty, in fear of want.",NA,NA
"Our NHS is being handed over to the private sector, resulting ina more expensive and inferior service, while highly skilled staffare underpaid and treated without proper respect.",NA,NA
"Governments of all colours – except Green – are failing to get to grips with climate change – the greatest challenge of our time.",NA,NA
"Yet none of this is inevitable – there is a real alternative. We do not apologise for being bold, ambitious or having a longterm vision for our country.  We certainly cannot continue as a nation on our current path.",NA,NA
"We believe in restoring and extending our public services to create good jobs and meet the needs of a diverse population.",NA,NA
"We believe in tackling climate change – taking serious action to limit our emissions at home and fi ghting for a fair global deal that secures humanity’s shared future.",NA,NA
"We believe that we can build a society that works for the common good – and that those with the broadest shoulders really should pay their fair share towards it.  Together, we can do this.  We must do this.  NATALIE BENNETT, GREEN PARTY LEADER",NA,NA

"CHAPTER 1",NA,NA
"Imagine a world of efficient and welcoming public services,","504",NA
"coordinated action on climate change,","107",NA
"equality,","503",NA
"workers’ rights,","701",NA
"an economy that works for people and planet at a human scale,","416",NA
"restorative justice,","000",NA
"and real care for the future,","501",NA
"including young people now.","706",NA
"Imagine a world in which we protect the planet, its land and its oceans, and the plants, animals and people that live on it.","501",NA
"Imagine a world of security for all,","503",NA
"of social security as opportunity not dependency,","504",NA
"of lives lived more locally, with services close to where people need them","503",NA
"and connected by affordable, energy-efficient public transport.","501",NA
"Imagine a government that believes in society,","606",NA
"in our common humanity,","606",NA
"in a culture of hope,","606",NA
"and in our capacity to govern ourselves.","606",NA
"Imagine a government that believes in the common good,","606",NA
"and that the best way of achieving it is by working for each other, rather than against each other.","606",NA
"Imagine honest government.","304",NA
"That’s the world the Green Party wants to make real.","606",NA
"It’s also the world that most of us want.","606",NA
"When asked to vote for policies rather than parties or personalities, Green policies consistently come out on top.","501",NA
"And it’s so different from what we have now.","305",NA
"In consumer societies like ours, the common good has been forgotten.","606",NA
"So much government has been outsourced, put out to tender.","606",NA
"The reins have been handed over to the unfettered market and big corporations.","403",NA
"They are given as the reason why we can’t do things (such as bring the railways back into public ownership),","413",NA
"why we must do things (lower taxes for the rich)","503",NA
"and how we must do things (privatise public utilities).","413",NA
"When government has been active it’s been to make the rich richer and the poor poorer,","503",NA
"while blocking action to prevent ecological catastrophe.","501",NA
"This has had disastrous consequences for the common good and for the protection of the natural world.","501",NA
"Back in the 1970s a determined assault on public life began, and the market became the model and measure of life.","416",NA
"Since then, successive governments of all colours have found ways to justify and deepen the role of the market in our lives.","416",NA
"Local government? Check out your nearest website or leaflet: you’re likely to be referred to as a customer, not a citizen.","301",NA
"Privatisation? Look at one of the most recent – Royal Mail.","413",NA
"This was owned by you and me, then it was sold for a song,","606",NA
"with windfall profits for companies doing the only job the market really understands – maximising shareholder profit.","403",NA
"The public lost £1 billion, while George Osborne’s best man’s hedge fund pocketed £36 million.","304",NA
"Outsourcing? This is what governments do when they’ve given up governing.","304",NA
"The result is a series of scandals from companies with increasingly infamous names – G4S, SERCO, ATOS – over which we have no control.","403",NA
"Zero-hours contracts? These are designed for companies looking to maximise profits through labour flexibility, but hopeless if you have regular bills to pay.","701",NA
"The market has been in charge for so long that it dominates our imagination and colours our view of ourselves.","403",NA
"The market is short sighted and short term.","403",NA
"It’s time for change – time to put the market to work for the common good and for people to be put back in charge.","403",NA
"The Green Party knows that:","305",NA
"It’s hard to be a citizen when life tells you that you are a consumer;","606",NA
"It’s hard to think of others when we are pitted against one another and sold the lie that individuals are to blame for their misfortunes;","606",NA
"and It’s hard to think of the common good when it’s never mentioned.","606",NA
"Private interests have ruled the roost for far too long.","403",NA
"The result is a society scarred by inequalities of power and wealth,","503",NA
"and a planet plundered of resources and damaged by pollution.","501",NA
"All in it together? We don’t think so.","606",NA
"Those with power and wealth have done very well out of austerity:","503",NA
"the UK’s wealthiest 1% grab more than anywhere else in Europe.","503",NA
"Politics has fragmented, public institutions have weakened, people’s lives are dominated by insecurity, and prejudice is rife.","202",NA
"We live in a price-tag society – and if you can’t pay the price, too bad.","503",NA
"Things that used to be done by public agencies have been outsourced.","413",NA
"Once it was a duty for all of us to look after the vulnerable when times were hard.","606",NA
"We paid taxes into a common fund to look after the poor, the weak, the old and the sick, and to educate the young.","606",NA
"This is what we did as citizens, bound together by what we share rather than separated by what divides us.","606",NA
"Now care has been outsourced to charity, to food banks.","503",NA
"Some think this is a sign of the Big Society, but we think it’s the sign of a failed society.","503",NA
"Individual charity is no substitute for collective justice.","503",NA
"For 40 years the rich and powerful have forced us to live in their fantasy world – a world that suits the minority not the majority.","503",NA
"This is a world imagined from the point of view of the healthy, the wealthy and the privileged.","503",NA
"Where there is a satisfying job just round the corner if only we could be bothered to look for it,","503",NA
"where resources are limitless,","503",NA
"and where the only obstacle to total fulfilment is the psychology of individual failure.","503",NA
"Meanwhile, in the real world where most of us live, we are young and old, sometimes poor and sick, jobs are scarce,","503",NA
"the Earth groans under the weight of our demands,","501",NA
"and the obstacles in the way of our flourishing can be stubborn and unyielding.","503",NA
"How should we organise life in this real world?","503",NA
"Do we want our security to depend on the underpaid zero-hours worker","701",NA
"of an outsourced company, maximising shareholder profit?","403",NA
"No, we want well-trained, committed workers, properly paid and secure in their own lives","701",NA
"– because our well-being is linked to everyone else’s.","606",NA
"Do we want a world in which privatisation is the solution for everything?","413",NA
"Or have we learnt from energy, water and rail that down that road lies private gain rather than the common good?","413",NA
"It’s public ownership and democratic control that lead to fairer services and better outcomes.","413",NA
"The market makes us impatient with the suffering of others, tolerant of inequality, prone to prejudice, suspicious of difference.","403",NA
"We know we can be cooperative, appreciative, understanding and fair.","606",NA
"We just need a world that encourages us to be these things.","107",NA
"Together we can create that world.","107",NA
"The challenges that lie ahead of us are unique in their combination: declining resources,","701",NA
"global warming,","701",NA
"deepening inequality,","701",NA
"footloose capital.","416",NA
"But these problems have been created by us, so they can be solved by us.","107",NA
"We need to remake society.","606",NA
"And in this remaking we need finally to realise that consumer capitalism is the problem, not the solution.","416",NA
"The solution lies in a democratically managed economy","202",NA
"that operates within the Earth’s resource limits.","416",NA
"We don’t want a privatised outsourced state, we want a green and democratic one.","202",NA
"We want a public National Health Service, not privatised healthcare.","413",NA
"The uncoordinated actions of millions of individuals, with unequal access to wealth and power and urged to maximise their own interests without regard for anyone else’s, will only deepen the crisis.","606",NA
"This is what’s on offer from the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, from Labour and from UKIP.","305",NA
"We need a party prepared to challenge the damage this has done, a party that expects something better.","305",NA
"We need a party prepared for the real world.","305",NA
"We need a party for the common good.","606",NA
"We need the Green Party.","501",NA
"Imagine having a secure, fulfilling and decently paid job, knowing that you are working to live and not living to work.","701",NA
"Imagine coming home to an affordable flat or house, and being valued for your contribution and character, not for how much you earn.","503",NA
"Imagine knowing that you and your friends are part of an economy that works with the planet rather than against it.","416",NA
"Imagine food banks going out of business.","503",NA
"Imagine the end of poverty and deprivation.","503",NA
"The key to all this is to put the economy at the service of people and planet rather than the other way round.","501",NA
"That’s what the Green Party will do.","501",NA
"What is the economy for?",NA,NA
"The main issue for many at this election is the economy.","408",NA
"Many people have very practical worries:","503",NA
"Is my job secure?","701",NA
"Will our family have enough this month to pay the bills and put food on the table?","503",NA
"Can we keep paying the mortgage or the rent?","503",NA
"Will we have to continue to work unreasonably long or unpredictable hours?","701",NA
"Is my pay fair compared with others?","701",NA
"Will my benefits be cut?","504",NA
"Will I ever get a pension?","504",NA
"Will I ever get a job with a future?","701",NA
"Will I ever pay off my student loan?","504",NA
"Will I ever find a decent place to live?","503",NA
"Will the economy provide a decent livelihood long into the future for our children and grandchildren?","503",NA
"Our solutions to these worries are very different from the other parties.","416",NA
"The Coalition parties and Labour agree on one thing about the economy: it’s got to grow because growth is the answer to everything.","416",NA
"If the costs include ruining our climate and countryside by exploiting shale gas, tolerating massive inequality and the insecurity of zero-hours contracts or massive underemployment – then too bad.","416",NA
"We don’t agree with the growth objective.","416",NA
"Our economic policy promotes a fair, just and more equal society","503",NA
"while recognising that we live on a finite planet.","501",NA
"It’s easy to forget the fact that everything we make and everything we buy comes from the Earth.","501",NA
"And we have only one of them.","501",NA
"If everyone on Earth consumed at the rate we do in the UK, we’d need nearly three planets to sustain us.","416",NA
"If it’s the average North American, then we’d need nearly four planets.","416",NA
"Greens are sometimes accused of being unrealistic about economics.","416",NA
"Nothing could be further from the truth.","416",NA
"It’s our opponents who are the fantasists, believing that continual growth is possible on a finite planet","416",NA
". Greens are the realists, understanding that the planet imposes limits and focusing on essentials such as jobs, housing and the household budget.","416",NA
"The economy depends on society,","606",NA
"which depends on the Earth and its resources.","501",NA
"That’s the order of things – not the other way round.","501",NA
"And what’s growth for, anyway?","416",NA
"The aim of politics is to help us flourish, and by this measure growth has failed in recent decades.","416",NA
"The Office for National Statistics (ONS) tells us that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per person has grown by more than three times since 1955, allowing for inflation.","416",NA
"Are we three or four times more content?","416",NA
"No, levels of life satisfaction have dropped in this period.","416",NA
"We’re told that growth has returned to the UK.","416",NA
"The result? More than one in four children is growing up in poverty.","416",NA
"The bosses of the UK’s 100 biggest companies earn on average 143 times more than their staff.","416",NA
"The top 1% of the population has the same wealth as the bottom 55%.","503",NA
"Five families in the UK have the same wealth as 12 million UK citizens.","503",NA
"913,138 people received three days’ emergency food from Trussell Trust food banks in 2013–14 compared with 346,992 in 2012–13.","503",NA
"Debt levels are growing.","416",NA
"By 2018, 2 million households are expected to spend more than half their disposable income repaying loans.","416",NA
"Household incomes adjusted for inflation are still on average 2% below what they were in 2009–10.","503",NA
"Joining up the policies.","305",NA
"Government is run too much by Departments, which rarely take any notice of each other.","303",NA
"Greens like to join things up...","305",NA
"So what do social justice and greater equality have to do with health, education, opportunity, the numbers in prison, and even recycling?","503",NA
"This manifesto has many other policies designed to improve all these things.","503",NA
"But just making us more equal will improve all of them.","503",NA
"So it’s not the economy, stupid.","416",NA
"Or at least not one that grows forever.","416",NA
"The Green Party believes that equality is much more important than growth.","416",NA
"And growth doesn’t bring equality; in fact it helps to justify inequality.","416",NA
"The result of the corrosive trickle-down fantasy is plain: the sixth-richest society in the world is disfigured by high levels of deprivation.","416",NA
"And it’s not only those right at the bottom who have problems.","416",NA
"Despite the fact that household incomes are now back to 2007–08 levels, families on ordinary incomes have faced a real squeeze since 2009–10 as prices go up and incomes stagnate.","503",NA
"We will abandon GDP and the pursuit of growth as a measure of economic success.","416",NA
"We would use a measure of Adjusted National Product (ANP), which would take account of capital and environmental depreciation and include the value of many things not currently paid for, such as unpaid work at home.","416",NA
"Green councillors mobilise alternatives to payday lenders...","305",NA
"In a move to break people’s dependence on payday lenders, in Stowmarket, Suffolk, Councillor John Matthissen is leading a cross-agency project to launch a collection and information point for the local credit union.","403",NA
"Short-term economic stimulus",NA,NA
"We make an important distinction between short-term growth, or ‘regeneration’, and long-term dependency on continuing economic growth.","409",NA
"The measures we propose as alternatives to austerity will, by halting and reversing the cuts to public services, restore lost jobs and create new ones.","409",NA
"The increased economic activity will cause the economy to grow rather than shrink in the short term, restoring employment and living standards.","409",NA
"However, we see such short-term growth as transitional, as a side-effect of ending the failed austerity project.","409",NA
"We do not see it as a contradiction to adapting the economy for One-Planet Living in the longer term.","107",NA
"Alternatives to austerity",NA,NA
"There is an alternative to austerity.","408",NA
"The crunch of 2008 was the result of the pressures of our consumer society and an unregulated finance system; people borrowed too much and banks were too willing to lend.","403",NA
"Now people and businesses are paying down their debts, businesses contract haphazardly and workers are laid off.","403",NA
"The Coalition’s reaction was to use this as an excuse to impose austerity – in order to cut the debt, especially the government’s deficit – while doing little to strengthen the economy.","410",NA
"The winners are those who absorb corporate surpluses, the chief executives and the shareholders.","403",NA
"The biggest losers are the unemployed, the low paid and the vulnerable, especially those who depend on public services.","403",NA
"Labour plans to match the Tories’ ‘fiscal envelope’ for Departmental spending – code for more austerity.","408",NA
"We think the economy should work for us all.","410",NA
"We want a One-Planet economy that will address the challenge of climate change and unacceptable levels of inequality.","107",NA
"We have to throw off the shackles of market ideology and consider afresh what really needs to be done.","403",NA
"We need to: Ensure that everyone who wants one has a decent secure job paid at least a living wage.","412",NA
"So we have to encourage and create jobs.","701",NA
"In total, the policies in this manifesto will create over 1 million jobs.","701",NA
"See the section on Work in Chapter 9.","701",NA
"Address the issue of climate change.","501",NA
"We need huge investment in using energy more efficiently and generating energy sustainably.","501",NA
"This will not happen without public investment.","501",NA
"See Chapter 4 on Energy and Climate.","501",NA
"Stabilise and tightly regulate the financial sector, whose greed and recklessness have been a major cause of our recent economic difficulties and of growing inequality.","403",NA
"See the section on Finance in Chapter 9.","403",NA
"Provide equality and security in a mixed economy by committing to the common good, a larger public sector and higher taxation, funding our health, education and local services properly, and creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.","403",NA
"See the section on Taxes in Chapter 9.","403",NA
"Be prepared to borrow on good terms to fund investment rather than making closing the deficit the main objective of our economic policy.","409",NA
"The plans in this manifesto require borrowing of £338 billion (in real 2015 terms) over the Parliament as compared with the Coalition’s plan in the 2015 Budget to borrow £115 billion.","409",NA
"If monetary policy demands quantitative easing, we will spend that money directly on green investment.","501",NA
"However, the programme of public spending and taxation in this manifesto would show a surplus on the current account (that is, excluding investment) of 2.7% by the end of the Parliament.","408",NA
"Reject the dogma that everything is best done by the private sector.","403",NA
"A sensible economy is a mixed economy, where some things – health, education and public transport, for example – are better in community or public ownership.","403",NA
"See Chapters 6, 7 and 12 on Health, Education and Transport.","403",NA
"Support those without jobs and treat them with respect in a system that makes getting some work worthwhile","701",NA
"`and provides pensions that allow older people to live with dignity.","504",NA
"`See Chapter 10 on Social Security.","504",NA
"Mobilise the talents and energy of everyone and serve everyone,","503",NA
"`including the young and the old, men and women, those who are disabled and minority groups, including ethnic minorities and different sexual orientations.","503",NA
"See Chapter 5 on Equalities.","503",NA
"Recognise that not everything that is valuable has a price attached to it.","503",NA

"Create a robust taxation system that promotes equality","503",NA
"and sustainability.","501",NA
"Rein in huge companies that put shareholder returns ahead of the common good.","403",NA

"Create an efficient economy that encourages innovation and the use of science but does not rely on dangerous technologies.","416",NA
"See the Science section in Chapter 3.","416",NA

"and that is willing to assist countries poorer than ours.","107",NA
"See Chapter 13 on International Affairs.","107",NA
"Ensure that the Treasury’s priority objective is to deliver an economy with these aims.","107",NA
"How we will do this is set out in detail in the following chapters.","305",NA
"CHAPTER 3",NA,NA
"The third planet from the sun.","501",NA
"Our home.","501",NA
"Home to 9 million other species.","501",NA
"The only planet with liquid water at its surface.","501",NA
"The only planet in the solar system with 21% oxygen.","501",NA
"As far as we know, the only planet in the solar system that sustains life.","501",NA
"Imagine a political party that prioritises the protection of the land, the seas and their inhabitants.","501",NA
"Imagine one that believes that animals have a right to flourish and aren’t just a means to the end of human satisfaction.","501",NA
"Imagine one that believes the common good embraces other species and not just our own.","501",NA
"That’s what a real political party, the Green Party, does.","501",NA
"The Earth is our home, and this is what we are doing to it: We have lost half the wild animals on Earth in the past 40 years.","501",NA
"We lose between 200 and 100,000 species every year.","501",NA
"This is between 1,000 and 10,000 times faster than the natural extinction rate.","501",NA
"We are causing a ‘sixth extinction’.","501",NA
"The other five occurred naturally; this one is down to us.","501",NA
"We have increased CO2 concentrations from a pre-industrial 280 parts per million (ppm) to about 400 ppm.","501",NA
"Global temperatures are due to rise between 1.5 and 4.8 degrees C by 2100.","501",NA
"And that’s just the internationally agreed range without feedback effects.","501",NA
"Many experts are predicting rises as high as 6 degrees C.","501",NA
"For the first time in the history of the Earth one species is changing it forever – the human species.","501",NA
"They call this new era the ‘Anthropocene’.","501",NA
"We now have our very own geological epoch.","501",NA
"This brings with it massive responsibilities, which no other party understands or acknowledges.","501",NA
"The rich and powerful, in particular, have spent too long treating the Earth like an indestructible storehouse, to be thoughtlessly pillaged of its natural resources.","416",NA
"UK biodiversity is threatened by development and agricultural practices such as intensive farming, the draining of wetlands and the deforesting of hills.","501",NA
"Genetic selection is causing endemic health and welfare problems in domestic and farmed animals.","501",NA
"Animal experimentation is still routine; millions of animals suffer pain and death every year in the UK.","501",NA
"Overfishing is devastating marine ecosystems.","501",NA
"Our attitude to the natural world is epitomised by the fact that some circuses still tour with wild animals, including zebras, lions, snakes, tigers and camels.","501",NA
"The Green Party will put policies in place that will stop us treating other species and the wider environment as a means to the satisfaction of humans only.","501",NA
"This is because the common good includes other species too.","501",NA
"We depend on them for our own welfare.","501",NA
"Every second breath we take is made possible by phytoplankton releasing oxygen into the oceans.","501",NA

"The science makes it clear that, to avoid the risk of runaway climate change, we must leave around four-fifths of all existing fossil fuel reserves in the ground.","501",NA
"So the problem now is not too little fossil fuel but too much.","501",NA
"Exploiting new sources of unconventional fossil fuels such as shale gas and oil and tar sands is incompatible with tackling climate change.","501",NA
"We must reduce our dependency on oil, coal and gas as quickly as possible while developing a society that can thrive on renewable energy.","501",NA

"Why we need to do better than the Climate Change Act","501",NA
"If the global average temperature rise can be kept below 2 degrees C, runaway or disastrous climate change can be avoided,","501",NA
"though severe damage will occur in some parts of the world.","107",NA
"Many countries and civil society organisations argue that the international goal should be to keep to 1.5 degrees C of warming, highlighting the severity of the climate impacts we are already seeing.","107",NA
"All countries including the UK agreed at Copenhagen in 2009 to recognise the need to limit the average temperature rise to below 2 degrees C, despite the fact that the UK’s climate change target means that there is an almost two-thirds (63%) chance of exceeding this 2 degrees C.","107",NA
"To meet the 2 degree C target, the world needs to limit total global emissions over the rest of the century to about 1,000 gigatonnes (Gt) CO2.","107",NA
"Current projections have us exceeding that figure by 2040, leading to devastating average warming of around 4 degrees C by the end of this century.","501",NA
"As the UK has about 1% of the world’s population, its allowable budget would amount to 10 Gt CO2.","701",NA
"But the UK is a relatively rich country that has benefited from the world’s highest cumulative historical emissions per person.","503",NA
"The Green Party therefore believes that the UK should plan to emit only half this amount by 2030 (which amounts to around 80 million tonnes CO2 a year by 2030),","503",NA
"and have negligible emissions thereafter.","501",NA
"This translates into our target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 10% of their 1990 levels by 2030.","501",NA
"This goes much further than the 80% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2050 mandated by the Climate Change Act.","501",NA
"Using energy wisely",NA,NA
"Renewables can supply all the energy we need for a comfortable standard of living, but only if we invest wisely and manage our demand more sensibly – by reducing energy waste and improving efficiency.","416",NA
"The Green Party would seek to cut energy demand by one-third by 2020,","416",NA
"one-half by 2030","416",NA
"and two-thirds by 2050.","416",NA
"The UK already has the technology it needs.","416",NA

"New local jobs will be created for trades people to install insulation, solar panels and heat pumps.","701",NA
"The four Greens on Kirklees Council secured three years of free home insulation funding, against the active opposition of Labour councillors, who later tried to claim credit!","501",NA
"This saved householders around £76 per year at 2011 prices","503",NA
"and cut emissions.","501",NA
"It also created 243 jobs in the local economy.","701",NA
"Carbon quotas – how they would work The fairest way to share emissions rights is equally.","503",NA
"So we support the idea of an economy-wide system of carbon quotas, with everyone guaranteed the same basic entitlement, regardless of wealth.","503",NA
"Those who use less than this could sell some of their quota to those who use more, rewarding their carbon thrift.","501",NA
"About half the available carbon units could be distributed, free of charge, to all adults in the country.","503",NA
"The rest of the carbon units could be sold by the government to companies and other organisations.","501",NA

"We will end the dominance of the Big Six energy companies.","403",NA
"We will stabilise the ‘policy landscape’ for renewable energy to provide certainty for investment decisions, including long-term targets and stable feedin tariffs.","403",NA
"We will: Maximise opportunities for community or municipally owned, or cooperative not-for-profit organisations to generate and supply electricity and heat at the retail level.","403",NA

"Secure public control over the strategic direction and policies of the National Grid.","413",NA
"Support long-term stable fixed-price feed-in tariffs for renewable energy generators.","412",NA
"Ensure that consumer energy tariffs are progressive, so small consumers pay less per unit than larger ones,","403",NA
"that special needs are recognised,","503",NA
"that people are not cut off when they can’t afford to pay,","503",NA

"whose objectives include achieving climate change targets","501",NA
"as well as protecting consumer interests.","403",NA
"Why we say no to fracking","416",NA
"Fracking is a process where water, sand and chemicals are injected at high pressure into shale rocks under the ground to release shale gas or oil.","416",NA
"Three years ago we called for a moratorium on fracking-related activity while the environmental and economic impacts of drilling for shale gas were evaluated.","416",NA
"On that basis, we are now emphatic and unambiguous in proposing an outright ban on fracking and related extreme energy technologies (coal-bed methane and underground coal gasification, as well as hydraulic fracturing).","416",NA
"Fracking is incompatible with the UK’s climate change obligations.","416",NA
"There is already around five times more fossil fuel globally than we can safely burn if are to avoid dangerous climate change.","501",NA
"Encouraging a whole new fossil fuel industry is deeply irresponsible and undermines international efforts to secure a global climate agreement.","416",NA
"Fracking will put communities and our environment at risk.","416",NA
"There are serious and legitimate concerns about the potential for fracking to cause water contamination, air pollution and harm to wildlife and public health.","416",NA
"Fracking sites would entail mass lorry movements, blighting our countryside and villages.","416",NA
"Speeding the renewables revolution",NA,NA
"The Green Party strategy for energy efficiency ensures that we can change to an energy system based mainly on electricity from renewables within 15–20 years (a little longer for transport).","416",NA
"This will require substantial investment over the period.","416",NA
"We also need to pay more attention to energy storage.","416",NA
"So we will: Invest substantial amounts of public money (up to £35 billion over the Parliament) in renewable generation and in the National Grid, if necessary, to make sure renewable generation grows quickly enough.","416",NA
"This would include both large-scale generation and small- and medium-scale renewable generation schemes funded through local authorities.","416",NA
"This capacity would not necessarily be publicly owned and would include community-owned schemes.","416",NA
"Give the Green Investment Bank full borrowing powers to help fund this investment.","501",NA
"Concentrate on expanding mature renewable technologies such as wind energy and solar PV in the period until 2030","501",NA
"and bringing down costs, in part by reducing planning constraints, including those for onshore wind.","501",NA
"Ensure that all schools, hospitals and other public buildings have solar panels by 2020.","501",NA
"Encourage all social landlords to develop plans to install solar panels on all suitable properties, building on Kirklees Council’s pioneering £10 million plan to install solar panels on 2,000 Council homes over the next two years.","501",NA
"Schemes such as these can save people on low incomes the equivalent of up to two weeks’ rent.","503",NA
"Set deployment targets to bring down costs and attract investment in manufacturing and supply chains,","402",NA

"Ban all UK fracking operations – following a growing number of nations worldwide – and withdraw all relevant licences as soon as possible.","416",NA
"Ban other new fossil fuel developments such as other unconventional fossil fuels and open cast coal.","416",NA
"End fossil fuel industry tax breaks, phase out other harmful fossil fuel subsidies (domestic and international) and use the money saved to help fund other parts of our energy programme.","416",NA
"Work with financial institutions, local councils and others to encourage divestment from fossil fuels and develop alternative investment in efficiency and renewables programmes.","416",NA
"Support the potential deployment of carbon capture and storage to existing biomass and gas power stations only as a transitional technology.","416",NA
"Develop biomass generation only where it can be done in a sustainable way giving regard to the environmental and human costs of some large-scale biomass fuel operations.","416",NA
"Set in law a decarbonisation target for the power sector of 25–50 grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour by 2030.","501",NA
"Expand electricity storage capacity, including using the potential storage capacity of electric vehicles, and develop the commercial and regulatory framework to make this a reality.","501",NA
"Introduce smart meters and appliances.","416",NA
"Adapting to climate change",NA,NA
"Apart from rebuilding the UK’s energy system, we also need to adapt to the climate change that will take place as the effects of past emissions work their way through the system.","501",NA
"In the UK there will be wetter winters and hotter and drier summers.","501",NA
"We can expect greater instability, with more episodes of extreme weather, such as the heavy rain and floods of the 2013–14 winter.","501",NA
"We need to begin urgently to prepare for this by: Providing help for people and communities to prepare for an increasingly variable climate.","501",NA
"We would give an extra £1 billion a year to local authorities and the Environment Agency to spend on assisting communities with flood protection","501",NA
"and on defending homes and public buildings, such as hospitals, from heat waves.","501",NA
"Obliging government departments and local authorities to consider climate change and carbon reduction in all their planning over a long time horizon of 50–100 years.","501",NA
"Specifically, local authorities should do so in all planning decisions.","501",NA
"Having the government act as an insurer of last resort where commercial insurance companies are refusing to provide flood cover.","501",NA
"Preventing new building on flood plains.","501",NA
"Encouraging storing water in uplands through full river system management – including wetland restoration, natural regeneration, allowing rivers to meander and allowing flooding upstream.","501",NA

"Nuclear energy – it’s still no thanks","416",NA
"In recent years, the nuclear industry has tried to re-brand itself as ‘green’.","416",NA
"As the UK’s only environmental party, the Green Party needs to set out why it still considers that nuclear is no answer to either climate change or our energy needs.","416",NA
"Nuclear energy is not green.","416",NA
"Nuclear energy is neither zero carbon nor renewable and there is serious debate about whether it is even low carbon.",NA,NA
"Uncertainties involved in carbon costing, radioactive waste management and the carbon costs of obtaining uranium mean that the carbon costs of nuclear are unknowable.","416",NA
"Unlike renewables, we simply cannot rely on it being low carbon.","416",NA
"In addition to its highly dubious ‘low-carbon’ credentials, nuclear energy is a seriously flawed policy in other ways:","416",NA
"Nuclear energy is extremely expensive: not one nuclear plant has ever been built, anywhere in the world by private investors without huge public subsidies.","416",NA
"The Coalition government has agreed to guarantee EDF nearly double the current market electricity price at Hinkley, in addition to other financial backing not available to other low-carbon generators.","416",NA
"These subsidies would impose enormous and unjustifiable costs on householders and businesses.","416",NA
"Nuclear remains a uniquely dangerous form of energy.","416",NA
"If the new plant being built by EDF at Hinkley were to release an equivalent amount of radiation to Fukushima, and the wind was in the south-west, Bristol would need to be permanently evacuated.","416",NA
"No long-term solution has yet been found to the question of dealing with nuclear waste.","416",NA
"Wind power has been found to create around 12 times as many jobs as the same investment in nuclear, and solar power is estimated to create around 360 times as many jobs.","501",NA
"Investing in energy efficiency (e.g. insulation) creates even more jobs.","501",NA
"Renewables can provide the same ‘base load’ production as nuclear power at a lower cost without the risks.","416",NA
"Nuclear power diverts investment, skills and expertise away from securing the economic, employment and energy security benefits of home-grown renewables, smart grids and demand reduction.","416",NA
"The current UK nuclear programme is planned around a reactor design, the European Pressurized Reactor (EPR), which has an atrocious construction and cost record.","416",NA
"EPRs being built in France and Finland are years behind schedule and have huge cost overruns.","416",NA
"Even if nuclear were the answer, the EPR would still be the wrong plant to build.","416",NA
"CHAPTER 5",NA,NA

"We’d all be healthier, happier and more confident.","503",NA
"This could be the real world the Green Party creates.","503",NA
"The Green Party is opposed to inequality not just because it is wrong in itself and because more equal societies are happier societies,","503",NA

"We care about what happens before you access the NHS.","504",NA
"Get that right, and a lot else falls into place.","504",NA
"How to achieve this affects how we organise the health service.","504",NA
"Those involved in primary and community care – GPs, practice nurses, district nurses, health visitors, midwives, counsellors, pharmacists, occupational therapists and all the other community based professionals – are best placed to prevent ill health from developing in the first place.","504",NA
"They can carry out checks and give advice or treatment to people who, for instance, are stressed, obese, inactive, or alcohol or nicotine dependent.","504",NA
"Intervention by a trusted health professional can make the difference at an individual level.","504",NA
"This can often be linked to local services, such as advice centres, opportunities for physical activity, lunch clubs and so on.","504",NA
"And it’s primary care that is most important in dealing with problems before they become acute and require costly and distressing interventions such as admission to hospital.","504",NA
"Local health professionals can also manage chronic illnesses such as diabetes, respiratory and cardiac conditions and mental illness in ways that are both more patient centred and less expensive than hospitalbased care.","504",NA
"They are best placed too to integrate medical and social care.","504",NA
"Where parents want it and there are no medical complications, normal childbirth could take place at home, increasing satisfaction for the woman in labour and reducing costs for the NHS.","504",NA
"Similarly, many people would prefer to spend their last days at home rather than in hospital and a small increase in community care would save hospital beds and make the experience better for the dying patient, their family and friends.","504",NA
"We would therefore place more emphasis on prevention and on primary and community care and less on hospitals.","504",NA
"We would: Restore the proportion of NHS funding for primary care from the present 7% to 2005 levels (11%) and review the case for increasing it further;","504",NA
"we would also ensure that the distribution of funding reflects the local need.","504",NA

"Patient care has been damaged by two policies:",NA,NA
"punitive governance based on arbitrary targets;",NA,NA
"over-management by numbers to achieve those targets, leading to a climate of fear among managers and frustration among professionals.",NA,NA
"The NHS should have the needs of the patient at its heart. Ultimately, healthcare is provided by a professional to a person in need. Every interaction should begin by connecting with that person to really understand their needs. Interventions – from simple advice or booking an appointment, to planning complex medical treatment – will then be more appropriate and efficient, of real value to the user and economic for the organisation.",NA,NA
"The NHS has been subjected to 20 years of ideological tampering by successive governments (marketisation, targets and performance-related pay) to the point where professionals are often prevented from responding appropriately to an individual’s needs. This has also driven up the cost of care. Fragmentation of care, especially outsourcing, has led to a loss of continuity, so the human relationship between professional and patient is diluted. Professionals can no longer make the overall care of the patient their primary aim. Huge amounts of time and money are wasted on ‘failure demand’ – where the patient goes round in circles trying to get an answer to their problem and often has unnecessary investigations and treatment.",NA,NA
"More problems are created by so-called ‘economies of scale’ where, in an attempt to emulate industry, common services have been merged into larger entities regardless of the nature of the variety of demand. Individual and local knowledge are lost and problems are dealt with according to protocols and pathways, not what is best for the patient. This has to change. The system must be designed around what the patient needs, not what Monitor (the sector regulator for health services in England) or the Care Quality Commission demand. Professionals must be given the time to care, rather than ticking governance boxes.",NA,NA
"The ‘human-centred’ approach also applies to NHS staff. The vast majority of NHS workers are highly committed, caring and careful individuals, but current systems often put them under stress and prevent them doing the right thing. We need a culture in which all staff are able to shape the system they work in and to openly share learning from mistakes and ‘near misses’. It should be a source of pride and joy, not fear and frustration, for those who work in it.",NA,NA

"Higher education",NA,NA
"Higher education is in crisis.","506",NA
"The fundamental purpose of universities should be to promote critical enquiry, social innovation and cultural renewal.","506",NA
"But these aims have been sidelined in an atmosphere of increasing managerialism and commercialisation.","506",NA
"Higher education is vital to our cultural health.","502",NA
"It should be concerned with public engagement and increasing social participation, not considered merely a production line for enhancing the earning power of individuals.","502",NA
"The current focus on research ‘outputs’– in the narrow definition used by the Research Excellence Framework – means that the crucial role of lecturers as teachers has been denigrated.","506",NA
"This emphasis needs to be reversed.","506",NA
"The Conservative-led Coalition and the Labour Party bear responsibility for the current system of university funding, which is largely dependent on tuition fees that now stand at £9,000 a year for undergraduates.","506",NA
"This was a betrayal of a promise and has blighted the future of thousands of young people who now graduate with a debt of at least £45,000.","506",NA
"With the removal of public funding from most undergraduate and all postgraduate courses, UK universities are now all but privatised.","413",NA
"The only people to benefit from the current system are university Vice-Chancellors and senior bureaucrats, who award themselves massive pay rises, while those on the ground who carry out teaching and research face ever more punishing terms and conditions of employment.","503",NA
"In practice, this severely compromises the quality of education through reduced student-contact hours with overstretched staff.","506",NA
"Zero-hours contracts are now commonplace and shocking disparities in pay characterise every campus, especially among service workers, who are commonly denied a living wage.","701",NA
"Conversely, university administrative departments continue to swell as money is routinely wasted on copying expensive private sector practices – including ludicrous rebranding exercises – in search of ‘market share’.","413",NA
"The future of the arts and the humanities has been endangered by a systematic denigration by the dominant political parties and university administrations alike, who create a perception of such courses as an expensive luxury without the vocational ‘use-value’ that renders them worth the financial risk.","502",NA
"The Green Party believes that the arts and humanities have an essential part to play in creating a more democratic, sane and participatory society.","502",NA
"The situation for mature students is even more dire.","506",NA
"Over the past five years, every continuing education department in the UK has been scaled back or closed down altogether, often as a managerial response to caps on students numbers and diminished funding for the sector as a whole.","506",NA
"Adults wishing to return to education are faced with a situation where short courses and part-time study are considered not cost-effective in market terms.","506",NA
"In December 2010, just after the trebling of tuition fees, Caroline Lucas MP argued that the costs of a free higher education could be met by increasing corporation tax for larger companies to the level paid in other G7 countries and ring-fencing some of that money.","506",NA
"Businesses depend enormously on graduates’ skills and knowledge, so it’s only fair that they invest in the higher education system from which they benefit.","503",NA
"Allied to this, the cost of studying the qualifications that universities stipulate as entry requirements is prohibitive.","506",NA
"An ‘A’ level for those who are not registered as school or college students attracts a fee of several hundred pounds.","506",NA
"Access to education diplomas are also meshed within a loan system for those over the age of 24, and uniformly cost in excess of £3,000.","506",NA
"The part-time and short courses for which non-traditional applicants can enrol are often hugely expensive, especially when measured against the contact-time with lecturers.","506",NA
"‘Lifelong Learning’ is a phrase that is much used by politicians and education professionals.","506",NA
"Giving people the opportunity to be ‘second chance’ learners should be a crucial part of what universities offer to wider society.","506",NA
"Countering the monetisation of higher education across the entire sector is vital to reverse the destructive and wasteful market model of university education.","413",NA
"The Green Party would address this through: Ending undergraduate tuition fees.","506",NA
"We appreciate that the current level of applications to study at university reflects the paucity of other opportunities available to young people.","503",NA

"To be saddled with a huge debt for the right to access higher education at the beginning or middle of adulthood is neither ethical nor sustainable.","506",NA

"The fact that the size of our money supply – the total amount of money in circulation – is dependent upon millions of separate commercial lending decisions by banks makes it hard to maintain economic stability.","403",NA
"During the great recession of the past few years, the unwillingness of banks to make new loans and the desire of people to pay down their debts has meant that the money supply has shrunk, and the government has had to resort to the emergency policy of printing money (called ‘quantitative easing’) to prevent an even worse slump.","403",NA
"We believe that the time has come to recognise that the creation of currency and the control of the money supply is far too important to be left to profit-seeking private sector banks and should be brought back under the democratic control of the state.","413",NA
"Quantitative easing was but a first step.","403",NA
"Commercial banks should be no more than the custodians of publicly created money in current accounts, and the creation of that money should become the function of a new monetary authority, independent of day-today government control.","403",NA

"Tax redistributes wealth and pays for services that are important to us all.","503",NA
"There are services we share but don’t always use, such as roads, healthcare and schools.","503",NA
"We don’t all drive, we don’t all go to the doctor and we don’t all have children.","503",NA
"But we know these things are important for our common life: sharing these things binds us together.","606",NA
"Taxation pays for them.","503",NA
"And, to be fair, taxation needs to be progressive, taking proportionately more from those most able to pay.","503",NA
"What should we spend, and on what?","606",NA
"How much should we decide together to spend on the common good, and how much should be left for individuals to spend for themselves?","606",NA
"The pressure in the UK in recent years from the main three parties has been for the state to tax less and spend less, culminating in the dismantling of public services in the name of austerity.","606",NA
"But we need to put this in a wider context, in both space and time.","606",NA
"Different countries spend different amounts of their national income on public goods.","606",NA
"The table below compares the Green Party plan, set out in this manifesto, of 45% of GDP spent on public goods with other European countries and the USA, and with the planned decline in investment in the public sphere in the UK.","606",NA
"Every percentage drop represents an assault on the ties that bind us together,","606",NA
"on support for those who most need it","503",NA
"and on investment in a democratic, just and sustainable economy.","202",NA
"And the level of spending on the common good has changed over time, responding to changing circumstances.","606",NA
"In 1900, UK government spending was just 14% of GDP.","606",NA
"Much of that was defence; there was no welfare state.","105",NA
"Spending climbed to 57% in 1918, the last year of the First World War.","606",NA
"During the inter-war years spending fell back to around 27%, only to climb to a new peak of 70% at the end of the Second World War.","606",NA
"With the creation of the welfare state, spending fell back less after the Second World War, and has moved between 38% and 46% in the past 20 years.","606",NA
"What do the cuts mean?","606",NA
"After George Osborne’s 2014 Autumn statement, the Director of the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies asked ‘How will these cuts be implemented?","000",NA
"Is this a fundamental reimagining of the role of the state?’","606",NA
"The answer is yes.","606",NA
"The Coalition used to say that it was cutting out of necessity.","606",NA
"But this pretence was dropped in 2013 when David Cameron admitted that his commitment to cuts was ideological and permanent: ‘We are sticking to the task... this... means building a leaner, more efficient state.","606",NA
"We need to do more with less.","606",NA
"Not just now, but permanently.’","606",NA
"Now we know what this means: more for the rich, less for the poor.","606",NA
"There are three reasons for a fundamental shift to increased taxation and spending:","606",NA
"To reverse the politically inspired, damaging and unnecessary cuts in public services we have faced in recent years;","606",NA
"To improve these services in key areas such as early education and social care for older people;","504",NA
"To meet the challenge of building an entirely new sustainable economy in a world where the private incentives of the market are simply not up to the job.","416",NA
"Almost half our income for the common good?","606",NA
"That’s what sustainability and equity require.","606",NA
"So the first purpose of taxation is to pay for the things we do in common, and to redistribute income and wealth between us.","606",NA
"But there is a second purpose.","606",NA
"Taxing something discourages us from buying or doing it.","606",NA
"Tax on tobacco reduces smoking.","606",NA
"Exempting the tax on something encourages us.","606",NA
"The exemption of aviation from fuel taxes was instituted long ago in the early days of flying to encourage aviation.","606",NA

"Finally, for a tax system to be seen to be fair, everyone must pay their tax.","503",NA
"The tax gap – that is, tax that is illegally evaded, legally avoided by exploiting loopholes, or for which collection is abandoned – is estimated to amount to more than £120 billion a year.","503",NA
"That’s more than the deficit, expected to be £75 billion in 2015.","503",NA
"It’s more than 30 times the total of benefit fraud, and twice the net cost of a Basic Income scheme.","503",NA
"The Green Party is the only party with the political will to make the system fair,","503",NA
"to collect unpaid taxes and to challenge powerful tax dodging both in the grey economy and by huge corporations.","403",NA
"Recent governments can’t be serious about collecting tax fairly and efficiently when HMRC staff have been cut from 93,000 in 2004 to just 52,000 in 2015.","305",NA
"Tax dodging Caroline Lucas MP secured a debate with the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury (Mr David Gauke) in order to champion a Fair Tax Mark, much like the Fair Trade Mark, to be awarded to companies that take their tax responsibilities seriously.","403",NA

"Green MPs will lead on bringing a Tax Dodging Bill before the next Parliament.","503",NA
"That’s the Green Party’s tax policy in a nutshell: tax for fairness and to redistribute income and wealth,","503",NA
"and tax for sustainability.","501",NA
"To make taxation fairer we would: Introduce a wealth tax of 2% a year on the top 1% (see the ‘Wealth tax’ box) to raise about £25 billion a year by the end of the Parliament.","503",NA
"We accept that such a tax would need to be phased in gradually and that the potential yield is uncertain.","503",NA
"We would tie the yield on the wealth tax to our proposals to lower employers’ National Insurance (see below); to the extent that revenues from the wealth tax grow, employers’ National Insurance will be reduced.","503",NA
"Get serious about collecting tax.","503",NA
"We would steadily increase staff in HMRC by 15,000 per annum over the Parliament, in particular reopening local offices.","303",NA
"This would cost successively an additional £1 billion each year and is estimated to bring in cumulatively each year an additional £6 billion, still only one-quarter closing the tax gap, and collecting an extra £30 billion a year by the end of the Parliament.","503",NA
"Introduce an urgent programme of legislation, starting with a Tax Dodging Bill designed to reduce the tax gap and establish a general anti-avoidance principle.","503",NA
"Our plans include obliging banks to provide information about companies automatically to HMRC, and abolishing the rule that allows non-domiciled residents not to pay tax on foreign income.","403",NA
"Consider making the £2 billion industry of designing, promoting and selling tax avoidance schemes illegal.","403",NA
"Introduce a Robin Hood tax of 0.1% on transactions in bonds and equities and 0.01% on derivatives, replacing the existing stamp duty on share transactions.","503",NA
"This would raise up to £20 billion a year later in the Parliament and would help stabilise financial markets.","403",NA
"Reform Council Tax by asking people in bigger homes to pay more and those in smaller ones less, and adding two additional bands at the top for the biggest homes worth more than around £2 million and £4.5 million.","503",NA
"Under these proposals two-thirds of people would pay less, with the more substantial increases for those in homes worth more than £1 million.","503",NA
"Overall this would be revenue neutral.","503",NA
"Make preparations to replace both Council Tax and the Uniform Business Rate by a system of Land Value Tax, where the level of taxation depends on the rental value of the land concerned.","503",NA
"The rates would be decided locally with no caps, and subject to a degree of equalisation between richer and poorer areas, and would be kept and spent locally.","503",NA
"Transition to Land Value Tax could begin by the last year of the Parliament, and then extend over the following 10 years.","503",NA
"Further details are in the ‘Land Value Tax’ box.","503",NA
"Abolish the employees’ National Insurance upper threshold.","503",NA
"This would raise £28 billion a year in a full year from those on higher incomes above £42,380, but we would phase this increase in, with the first half of it in 2016–17.","503",NA
"Raise the additional (top) rate of income tax to 60%.","503",NA
"This will help bring down the maximum salary ratio in any workplace from the best paid to the lowest paid to no more than 10:1 and also act as a disincentive to paying excessive salaries.","503",NA
"It would raise approximately £2 billion a year.","503",NA
"Not allow corporation tax relief on any part of a salary that exceeds the maximum allowed by the 10:1 ratio in that company, to make it harder for companies to pay excessive salaries.","503",NA
"Increase corporation tax from 20% to 30%, yielding around £12 billion a year in a full year.","503",NA
"Small firms would remain on 20%.","403",NA
"Abolish the capital gains tax personal allowance, raising around £3.8 billion a year.","503",NA
"Fundamentally reform inheritance tax and turn it into an accessions tax.","503",NA
"At present, inheritance tax is one of the easiest taxes to both avoid and evade, and the very rich usually find ways of paying very little.","503",NA
"We would make the level of the tax depend on the wealth of the recipient, not the donor, so that all bequests to individual recipients who have less than £200,000 would be tax free.","503",NA
"This would encourage people to spread their wealth more widely.","503",NA
"Counter avoidance by abolishing the seven-year rule and making all gifts by living donors subject to a similar accessions tax, with exemptions for small annual amounts as at present.","503",NA
"In addition we would tighten up the tax treatment of certain trusts widely used for inheritance tax purposes.","503",NA
"A wealth tax Most of the emphasis on inequality is about inequality of income.","503",NA
"But there is even more inequality in the ownership of accumulated wealth – property, pension rights, stocks and shares, and other assets.","503",NA
"The top 10% of households hold nearly half the UK’s wealth, the top 1% hold at least 12.5%.","503",NA
"Many other countries – France, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Spain and Norway for example – levy annual wealth taxes of up to 2%.","503",NA
"The Green Party is part of a movement to build a global wealth tax, the only sure way to counter avoidance and evasion of such taxes","503",NA
"The introduction of automatic information exchange for income tax purposes from 2016 from tax havens will make it easier to trace hidden wealth.","503",NA
"We would introduce a tax of 2% a year on the 1% of the population whose wealth exceeds £3 million.","503",NA
"There will be an exemption for farmers with agricultural land worth less than £10 million.","503",NA
"For those with little income and a rather illiquid asset such as a house, arrangements could be made to defer the tax until the sale of the house.","503",NA
"In a full year this tax could raise £25 billion.","503",NA
"To tax for sustainability we would commit the UK economy to a long-run plan to reduce the use of natural resources through the introduction of resource and pollution taxation.","501",NA
"In particular we would: Begin a major ecological shift in the taxation of companies by removing disincentives to employ people.","501",NA
"Specifically we would reduce employers’ National Insurance contributions by the same amount as the yield from the wealth tax above.","501",NA
"In the long run this will remove £25 billion a year from a tax on jobs, enabling the tax to be reduced from 13.8% of pay to around 8%.","503",NA
"Reintroduce the fuel duty escalator, raising £2.2 billion in 2015 and an additional £2.2 billion in each successive year through the Parliament.","501",NA
"Put aviation on a level playing field with other modes of transport by making it subject to fuel duty and VAT, raising £16 billion in a full year.","501",NA
"If outdated international law makes this impossible, introduce a flight tax dependent on distance and aircraft type that has the same overall economic effect.","501",NA
"Reduce VAT on housing renovation and repair work (including insulation) to 5%, costing £1.6 billion a year.","501",NA
"At present there is no VAT on constructing new dwellings but VAT at 20% on converting and renovating old buildings to be used as homes.","501",NA
"Reduce VAT on the tourism industry (meals and drinks out, accommodation and also live performances) to 5%, putting the UK on a level playing field with our international competitors and costing around £6 billion a year.","403",NA
"Tax plastic bags and unnecessary packaging, raising perhaps £1 billion by 2020.","501",NA
"Levy eco-taxes on non-renewables or pollutants, in particular pesticides, organo-chlorines, nitrogen and artificial fertilisers and phosphates, raising £1 billion by 2020.","501",NA
"Introduce new taxes on the use of water by businesses and on waste heat from power stations, raising £3 billion by 2020.","501",NA
"Increase alcohol and tobacco duties by a successive £1.4 billion every year in the Parliament.","416",NA
"Land Value Tax Land Value Tax is a system of local taxation where the landowner pays a proportion of the rental value of the land itself, but not of buildings or improvements upon it, in tax each year.","503",NA
"It has many advantages: It taxes the value of land and rents, which derive from nature and the efforts of the wider community and not from any effort by the landowner, rather than taxing wages and profits, which derive from labour and capital;","503",NA
"It is hard to avoid because land cannot be hidden or moved;","503",NA
"It dampens speculation in land and land hoarding;","503",NA
"It favours tenants in particular, since the tax cannot be passed on from the landowner, and would substitute for Council Tax, which tenants have to pay;","503",NA
"and It discourages landowners from not using derelict or vacant land.","503",NA
"The land would be valued at the value that could be obtained if sold for the current planning permitted use.","503",NA
"Commons, urban open space, some nature reserves and land used in common such as roads would be exempt.","501",NA
"The rate would be set by the local authority.","503",NA
"Special arrangements would allow those with land but a low income to pay their Land Value Tax upon the sale of their land or upon their death.","503",NA
"A Land Value Tax set at around 2% of total land values would raise about the same amount as Council Tax and Uniform Business Rate combined.","503",NA
"Moreover, 83% of properties would attract lower bills for Land Value Tax than for Council Tax (and many of these would be paid by the freeholder rather than the tenant).","503",NA
"Joining up the policies So what does taxation have to do with equality and sustainability?","503",NA
"It can be used to promote both, rather than promote things we don’t want.","503",NA
"It’s folly to give capital allowances to investment in coal-fired generation,","501",NA
"or VAT concessions to new buildings rather than reusing old ones.","501",NA
"It’s unjust to spend billions on tax relief on pension contributions used overwhelmingly by the rich,","503",NA
"or not to use inheritance tax to encourage people to spread their wealth.","503",NA
"Taxation is not just a matter of getting in the money for the common good; we can use it to shape behaviour.","503",NA
"It’s another virtuous circle.",NA,NA

"Introduction – what we have now",NA,NA
"In the world of the current government, social security means exactly the opposite of what it says on the tin.","504",NA
"Living on benefits is to experience constant insecurity, wondering if payments will stretch to cover today’s food, next week’s school bus, next month’s electricity bill.","504",NA
"It’s to experience discrimination, as society is divided into strivers and scroungers, the deserving and the undeserving poor, taxpayers and those on benefits","503",NA
"It’s to be subject to delayed payments and sanctions, which push you to the food banks.","505",NA
"It’s to lose up to four weeks’ payments simply for missing an interview.","504",NA
"Worst of all, the benefits system takes no account of people’s real lives.","504",NA
"You can pay more in transport costs to attend compulsory sessions at the Job Centre than you receive in benefits.","504",NA
"All the while, more and more people fall through the cracks in a social security system that, thanks to ideology and incompetence, offers no security.","504",NA
"Being on benefits creates a poverty trap that discourages employment or increased hours of work.","504",NA
"Yet work in today’s UK doesn’t pay either.","701",NA
"It’s why, for the first time, there are more people living below the poverty line in working families (6.7 million) than in workless and retired families combined (6.3 million).","701",NA
"It’s why one of modern UK’s growth industries is payday loan sharking.","701",NA
"And it’s one of the reasons why nothing short of a Green revolution in how we think about social security will do.","501",NA
"The Coalition government has introduced more work-for-benefits schemes, tougher rules on claiming benefits and more sanctions.","504",NA
"Job Centre staff are encouraged to do whatever it takes to get people off the dole and deny them the money to which they are entitled.","504",NA
"Employment and Support Allowance is a disgrace, with harsh, inaccurate fitness-for-work assessments that are frequently overturned on appeal.","504",NA
"Claimants suffer because of huge delays in assessment of Personal Independence Payments.","504",NA
"The Coalition’s flagship policy, a so-called simplification of the system, Universal Credit, is a disaster waiting to happen.","504",NA
"Implementation dates are constantly revised and the computer systems are never quite ready.","504",NA
"Although Universal Credit claims to improve incentives to work, if you earn an extra £100, £65 will be deducted from your benefit.","504",NA
"This is higher than the 45% tax charged on incomes over £150,000, yet we are told that, if we increase that top rate, high earners will lack incentives to work or will leave the country.","503",NA
"So should we be surprised if many on benefits decide not to work?","503",NA
"In a sensible world, we’d have much lower deductions from earnings for those who earn least.","503",NA
"Instead of entrenching the difference between being in and out of work, which is what mainstream welfare tries to do, the Green Party will work to eliminate it altogether.","503",NA
"Green MP Caroline Lucas and welfare reform In the last Parliament, Green MP Caroline Lucas took a stand against the removal of the link between benefit levels and inflation,","504",NA
"the government’s welfare reforms,","504",NA
"the widespread scapegoating of the poor and disabled,","503",NA
"and the myth that welfare and other public spending was the cause of the economic recession.","504",NA
"Here are some of her comments: ‘As well as being callous and cruel, the bedroom tax is counter-productive.’","503",NA

"A radical long-term plan to reform the tax and benefits system",NA,NA
"The Green Party thinks the time has come to reconsider the whole tax and benefits system and to rebuild it from the ground up","503",NA
"– a system not built on punishing and isolating people, making them jump through hoops to get hand-outs from the state, but one that goes back to the founding principles of the welfare state,","503",NA
"in the belief that, as members of society, we have a shared responsibility for one another’s well-being in times of need","606",NA
"and a shared commitment to helping others play the most active role they can in our society.","606",NA
"The idea in a nutshell is this.","606",NA
"Scrap most of the existing benefits apart from disability benefits and Housing Benefit.","503",NA
"Abolish the income tax personal allowance.","503",NA
"Then pay every woman, man and child legally resident in the UK a guaranteed, non-means-tested income, sufficient to cover basic needs – a Basic Income.","504",NA
"For those who earn, the Basic Income compensates for the loss of the personal allowance.","503",NA
"Children will receive a reduced Basic Income, Child Benefit.","504",NA
"Pensioners will receive their Basic Income at a higher level, as a Citizen’s Pension.","504",NA
"The advantages are many and we support the principle of a Universal Basic Income because it has the potential to: Act as a springboard rather than a safety net;","503",NA
"people can take jobs without fear of prosecution for working while on benefits;","503",NA
"Prevent people falling into absolute poverty rather than trying to help them when they are already there;","503",NA
"Reward people for all the work that’s done outside the formal economy, and most of this work is done by women;","503",NA
"Encourage more of this unpaid activity, much of which – such as food growing, fixing things that have gone wrong, converting older buildings, protecting the natural environment – is a vital part of a transition to a more sustainable economy;","501",NA
"Avoid the poverty trap in which an increase in wages leads to a massive loss of benefits;","503",NA
"Make everyone who earns, however little, a citizen who contributes to society by paying taxes, giving almost everyone a stake – raising the personal allowance takes us in precisely the wrong direction;","606",NA
"Be simple to administer and easy to understand.","303",NA
"Basic Income would be a massive change to the entire UK tax and benefits system.","503",NA
"We recognise that it would not be practicable or right to carry out that change within a single Parliament.","305",NA
"We are publishing alongside but separate from this manifesto a detailed set of proposals for a comprehensive Basic Income scheme.","504",NA
"It contains full details of the scheme itself, costings and proposals on how to pay for it, and an initial analysis of how the scheme would affect the net income of different groups.","503",NA
"We would use the forthcoming Parliament to Consult upon this scheme,","305",NA
"Have government departments carry out and commission research (including research into behavioural changes and how Basic Income would affect those on the lowest incomes and child poverty), and Draft appropriate legislation, with a view to implementing the full scheme in the following Parliament.","503",NA
"There are further things we would propose to do in the forthcoming Parliament as steps towards this major reform:","503",NA
"Reform the existing working-age benefits regime.","504",NA
"Pay an enhanced Child Benefit.","504",NA
"Introduce a universal Citizen’s Pension.","504",NA
"Working-age benefits",NA,NA
"A major problem with existing working-age benefits and tax credits is the poverty trap.","504",NA
"We would be prepared to invest up to £30billion over the Parliament to reduce the amounts that people lose from their benefits when they move into paid work and to fund the other changes to the benefits regime set out in this section.","504",NA
"In complex ways, eligibility for some benefits (e.g. Jobseeker’s Allowance) is lost altogether once a person is employed for a certain period, or reduced pound for pound if certain small disregarded amounts are exceeded.","504",NA
"Some other benefits (e.g. Housing Benefit) are reduced in a different way, by withdrawal rates that allow those earning to keep a small part of what they earn and not lose all of it.","504",NA
"We would make small changes in the direction of allowing those who earn some income from paid work to keep more of that income, starting with increasing the disregards for Income Support and Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA).","504",NA
"Initially we would increase the income disregarded on JSA for all categories of client to £50 a week,","504",NA
"with similar increases for those on Universal Credit.","504",NA
"It is not possible to be precise about how much the increased costs of such moves would be offset by more people on benefits taking up employment or working for longer hours.","504",NA
"Depending on results, we are prepared to invest up to £30 billion on such employment-stimulating measures over the Parliament.","504",NA
"We would also explore the introduction of a more generous treatment of earnings within Universal Credit for all claimants, whatever their housing circumstances.","504",NA
"We would also: Halt implementation of the Universal Credit programme and carry out a thorough review of its structure and implementation, including the treatment of earned income, and removing conditionality.","504",NA
"End work-for-benefits programmes, or workfare, and ensure a fair choice of waged work opportunities or voluntary training for jobseekers.","504",NA
"Ensure that all those on training or work placements as part of the benefits regime are either in college-based training or at work earning at least the minimum wage.","504",NA
"Review the harsh systems of sanctions and benefits caps introduced by the Coalition government and its predecessors.","504",NA
"Consider offering more personalised job-seeking support for people with mental health problems.","503",NA
"Restore Council Tax Benefit at the equivalent of 2012–13 levels for low-income householders, costing around £500 million a year.","503",NA
"`",NA,NA
"Cancel the Department for Work and Pensions contracts with the private sector for benefit entitlement assessment.","504",NA
"Restore the link between state benefits and earnings; ensure state benefits rise as fast as prices or wages, whichever of those grows more.","504",NA
"Abolish childcare tax credits and tax reliefs in the light of our proposals for free universal early education and childcare.","504",NA
"Pay students maintenance grants until Basic Income is introduced.","506",NA
"Raise the minimum wage and outlaw exploitative zero-hours contracts, so that the jobs taken by unemployed people are above a minimum standard.","412",NA
"Child Benefit",NA,NA
"Bringing up a child is expensive.","606",NA
"It is also vital work on behalf of society as a whole; those of us without children will depend on the children of others when we grow older.","606",NA
"It is right that society as a whole makes a contribution, as is recognised by our free state education system.","606",NA
"But that system needs two extensions: a free universal early education and childcare service (see Chapter 7 on Education),","504",NA

"This is running out, and we know we need to leave much of what is left in the ground.","501",NA
"We have to create a transport system based on sustainable alternatives.","501",NA
"We also have an increasingly car-dependent population because the cost of public transport has risen faster than wages and faster than the total cost of driving,","501",NA
"and in many areas public transport is so scarce that people have little alternative but to get around by car.","501",NA
"This has led to a public health crisis caused by rising levels of physical inactivity and health-damaging air pollution.","501",NA
"We also face an increasing toll of death and injury on the roads, particularly among pedestrians and cyclists who face unacceptable danger in our vehicle-dominated and congested towns, cities and villages.","501",NA
"Our privatised railways are fragmented and uncoordinated, ticket prices are high and unpredictable, and timetables do not connect seamlessly with buses at stations.","413",NA

"Long-distance travel by air is one of the most energy-intensive and polluting forms of transport and causes health-damaging local pollution near airports.","416",NA
"Aviation fuel goes untaxed and there is no VAT on tickets, amounting to a £16 billion a year subsidy in the UK.","416",NA
"We need a shift in priority, removing subsidies from air travel to invest in public transport that supports the common good.","416",NA

"The Green Party is committed to bringing rail services into public ownership and control.","413",NA
"The current fragmented structure does not put the passenger and the total journey experience at the centre of planning and has created a costly, wasteful, uncoordinated outcome.","413",NA
"Recent experience in running the East Coast Main Line within the public sector has shown that both quality and receipts to the Treasury go up when a rail service is run in this way,","413",NA

"And this ‘private’ system takes £4 billion in public subsidies every year.","413",NA
"Labour’s response is to require the state to bid for franchises it already owns – at millions of pounds a time.","305",NA
"As Caroline says, a privatised railway ‘is a blatant transfer of public money to private interests at the expense of the taxpayer and rail passengers’.","413",NA

"Migration",NA,NA
"Migration is a fact of life.","607",NA
"People have always moved within countries and between countries.","607",NA
"Much of the UK’s language, culture and way of life has been enriched by successive new arrivals over thousands of years.","607",NA
"Most families living here will have members of their extended family who live abroad or include members who were born abroad – 5 million British citizens live abroad, around 2 million of them in the EU.","607",NA
"We take it for granted that we can move to live where we like within our country, and increasingly within Europe and further afield, as others do.","607",NA
"Much of the time, migration is voluntary, is on a relatively small scale and is a positive benefit for all concerned.","607",NA
"But, increasingly, people are being forced to move because Climate change affects their environment so that it can no longer support them;","107",NA
"The economic opportunities in their home country are so limited that they leave home to work abroad;","107",NA
"or War, natural disasters or political repression lead them to become refugees.","107",NA
"These pressures lead to growing numbers of people seeking to come to the UK from the EU and elsewhere.","107",NA
"But it is wrong to scapegoat immigrants for problems with housing, education, health or local authority services.","503",NA
"These problems are the result of successive governments’ policy failure, which the rest of this manifesto is designed to put right.","107",NA

"Some controls on immigration will be needed for the foreseeable future; for now, we reject an open borders approach.","403",NA
"We also reject the imposition of an arbitrary numerical cap on net migration.","403",NA
"The latter in particular is impossible to achieve (especially given that there is no control on the numbers emigrating) and leads to many individual injustices.","503",NA
"Any controls must respect the following principles: Mutual legal obligations within the EU on freedom of movement.","108",NA

"Respect for the integrity of families.","603",NA
"The arrival of a grandmother might well have no direct economic effect, but her contribution to family life may contribute hugely to our society.","603",NA
"We would in particular abolish the policy that requires a British citizen to have an income of at least £18,600 a year before their partner can come to live in the UK, which discriminates against poorer people,","503",NA

"No restrictions on foreign students.","503",NA
"Foreign students contribute hugely to our education system, both financially and in terms of the wider perspectives they bring.","607",NA
"They also take back to their home countries skills that they have learnt here that will be valuable at home and positive attitudes towards the UK.","607",NA
"In particular we would allow students to work in the UK for two years after graduation;","607",NA

"Trade, aid and grassroots development",NA,NA
"People around the world have their own strategies and priorities for improving their lives and communities.","107",NA
"‘Development’ should not be directed by rich countries, which too often have their own business interests in mind.","107",NA

"International trade can benefit or harm the world’s people, depending on its nature.","107",NA
"Genuinely fair trade, alongside sustainable haulage practices, can bring benefits for all of us.","107",NA
"But ever-growing trade, over ever-growing distances and with the sole aim of making a profit can make life difficult for workers and is a sure-fire way of exceeding the limits of our finite planet.","107",NA
"Similarly, the world’s current structure of international institutions and trade rules can put less developed economies at a disadvantage, while making it easy for global corporations to buy up their land and resources.","107",NA

"CHAPTER 16",NA,NA
"In 2010 the major election issue was the economy, and in particular the state of the public finances.",NA,NA
"The Coalition parties pledged to close the deficit – the gap between government spending and government income.",NA,NA
"They have not done so; the gap between spending and income in 2009 of 11% of GDP has narrowed, but was still 5% in 2014.",NA,NA
"This is hardly surprising because the other parties’ election manifestos gave no costed plans for how they would reduce the deficit.",NA,NA
"They made promises but gave no details.",NA,NA
"We were treated to post-election surprises such as increased VAT and huge cuts to essential public services such as benefits, libraries, children’s centres and mental health support.",NA,NA
"By contrast, the Green Party produced a worked-out financial plan in its 2010 manifesto.",NA,NA
"Again in this manifesto, we are providing a costed plan for how we would protect and improve our NHS,",NA,NA
"schools",NA,NA
"and public services,",NA,NA
"and pay for them with fairer, more progressive taxation.",NA,NA
"We use current government data and show exactly how we would do things differently.",NA,NA
"In this financial plan, we take no account of any extra money that could be available to government as a result of ‘Regaining control of our money’ (see the box in Chapter 9) – instead, these plans are based on the real-world current economic environment and on strict assumptions about the effects of changes.",NA,NA
"Although it has not been our prime objective to end the current account deficit (that is, including expenditure other than investment) by the end of the Parliament, these plans show how we would do it.",NA,NA
"After a brief note on territorial coverage, there are three sections – our basic economic assumptions, our plans for spending and our plans for taxation.",NA,NA
"We conclude with the overall effect on government finances and on the gap between spending and income.",NA,NA
"We are publishing separately an illustrative costing for Basic Income.",NA,NA
"Note on territorial coverage",NA,NA
"This is the manifesto of the Green Party of England and Wales. Separate sister Green parties cover Scotland and Northern Ireland. Many public services are devolved, with the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly or the Northern Ireland Assembly taking responsibility. However, most decisions on government expenditure and on taxation are ultimately taken on a UK basis, this is a UK general election and, despite the fact that this Green Party covers only England and Wales, and to maintain consistency and comparability, all the figures in this chapter are UK figures.",NA,NA
"Economic assumptions",NA,NA
"The most important assumption is what the government assumes about the growth of the economy.",NA,NA
"If the economy grows, the revenues from taxation will be larger.",NA,NA
"Both Labour and the Coalition made optimistic assumptions about growth in 2010.",NA,NA
"We based our 2010 calculations on lower growth assumptions.",NA,NA
"In the event, the economy barely grew in the middle of the period and, although we were less wrong than Labour or the Coalition, we were still some way out.",NA,NA
"Many of the Coalition’s problems have their origin in this extraordinary optimism about growth.",NA,NA
"The figures are as follows: The Coalition is once again assuming growth of around 12% over the Parliament, at around 2.5% each year.",NA,NA
"We expect growth to slow a little over the Parliament.",NA,NA
"The figures are:",NA,NA
"Using these figures we can then work out our prediction for real GDP in each of the five years of the Parliament.",NA,NA
"All our figures throughout this manifesto, for both spending and revenues, are in real 2015 terms. Our government spending figures are worked out as follows. We use the current government plans for real terms spending in 2015 as a baseline (that is, we repeat the same figure for each year), so we are not taking into account the Coalition’s overall plans to cut public spending up to 2018. We then express what we’d do differently in terms of how much we’d increase or reduce each item relative to this baseline figure. In most cases there is some phasing of expenditure, recognising in particular that our changes cannot realistically start with a full year’s spending in 2015.",NA,NA
"Our additional expenditures include a line for changed interest on the national debt. Like the Coalition, we would fund the continuing deficit by borrowing. If we reduce the deficit more slowly than the Coalition’s plans, we would pay extra interest on the accumulated debt, and this line reflects that.",NA,NA
"Our proposed savings are as follows:",NA,NA
