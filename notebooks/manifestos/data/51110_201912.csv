"This is the manifesto of the Green Party of England and Wales. Separate sister Green parties cover Scotland and Northern Ireland. Many public services are devolved, with the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales or the Northern Ireland Assembly taking responsibility. However, most decisions on government expenditure and on taxation are ultimately taken on a UK basis, this is a UK general election and, despite the fact that this Green Party covers only England and Wales, and to maintain consistency and comparability, the policies in this Manifesto will cover the whole of the UK unless otherwise stated.",NA,NA
"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY","H",NA
"To tackle the Climate Emergency,","501",NA
"and deliver social justice, we propose:","503",NA
"The Green New Deal",NA,NA
"The Green New Deal will invest in our shared future, funding improvements in:","416.2",NA
"Energy: including the replacement of fossil fuels with renewable energy.","416.2",NA
"Housing: including the provision of better insulation for all homes that need it,","501",NA

"New green homes, new green transport and new green jobs will get us on track to reduce the UK’s carbon emissions to net zero by 2030","501",NA
"and provide new opportunities for everyone to live happier and more secure lives.","503",NA
"This will be a combined investment of over £100 billion a year in the Green New Deal,","402",NA
"with an additional investment in Universal Basic Income.","412",NA
"To help deliver the Green New Deal, we will deliver four further programmes of reform, closely integrated with our Green New Deal proposals:","501",NA
"Remain and Transform","H",NA
"A People’s Vote to decide the way forward on Brexit,","202.4",NA
"in which the Green Party will campaign for remain.","108",NA
"A commitment to realise the full potential of the European Union","108",NA
"to lead the fight against the Climate Emergency","501",NA
"and to improve the lives of workers,","701",NA
"low income families","503",NA
"and refugees.","201.2",NA
"Grow Democracy","H",NA
"Replacing First Past the Post with a proportional voting system,","204",NA
"giving 16-year-olds the vote,","202.1",NA
"reforming government to better combat the Climate Emergency","501",NA
"and devolving power to councils.","301",NA

"and making wellbeing the focus of our economy.","416.2",NA
"The New Deal for Tax and Spend","H",NA
"Ending wasteful spending on government vanity projects","303",NA
"and reforming our tax system so that the wealthiest pay their fair share.","503",NA
"THE GREEN NEW DEAL","H",NA
"Unleashing a Green Economic and Social Revolution","H",NA
"In 2019, we face a collective challenge greater than we have faced for decades.","606.1",NA
"The climate we all rely on is breaking down.","501",NA
"The impacts are starting to affect us all - the weather is becoming more extreme, wildlife is declining, sea levels are rising.","501",NA
"Our century is only 19 years old, but already we have had 18 of the hottest years on record.","501",NA
"This summer saw the hottest day ever recorded in the UK, and the hottest month ever recorded across the world.","501",NA
"and the hottest month ever recorded across the world.","501",NA
"None of this is happening by accident.","416.2",NA
"It’s the consequence of an out-of¬control economic system that plunders the Earth’s natural resources to create wealth for the few,","416.2",NA
"casting the climate into chaos","416.2",NA
"and causing corrosive levels of inequality.","503",NA
"It’s time for a new start, so we have developed the Green New Deal.","501",NA
"This is a comprehensive ten-year plan ambitious enough to tackle climate and ecological breakdown at the scale and speed set out by science.","501",NA
"It will deliver a fast and fair transformation of our economy and society, renewing almost every aspect of life in the UK:","416.2",NA
"from the way we produce and consume energy,","416.2",NA
"to the way in which we grow the food we eat,","416.2",NA
"and how we work, travel, and heat our homes.","416.2",NA
"As the originators of the Green New Deal, we are the only party you can trust to act in time to tackle the Climate Emergency","501",NA
"and rapidly reduce social and economic inequality","503",NA
"- and to make these our top priorities.","305.1",NA
"The Green New Deal will get the UK on track to reducing climate emissions to net zero by 2030 by:","501",NA
"Meeting most of our energy needs through the domestic production of renewable energy.","416.2",NA
"Reducing our overall energy demand from buildings and homes.","416.2",NA
"Transforming UK industry, transport and land use.","416.2",NA
"There will be a combined investment of over £100 billion a year in the Green New Deal,","402",NA
"with an additional investment in Universal Basic Income.","412",NA
"Through this investment, we will provide new opportunities for everyone to work","701",NA
"and live more sustainably and more securely.","416.2",NA
"The Green New Deal will deliver solid financial foundations across society, through a range of measures including:","416.2",NA
"The creation of millions of new jobs in renewable energy, transport, land management and other sectors","701",NA
"transformed by the transition to a net zero carbon economy.","501",NA
"The provision of the training people need to access these new jobs.","411",NA
"The creation of at least 100,000 new socially rented homes a year through low carbon construction and retrofitting, converting and extending existing buildings.","504",NA
"Implementing the Green New Deal will need to become a fundamental objective of government, nationally and locally, but it will also involve every single one of us: workers and investors, creatives and care workers, scientists and seniors, administrators and accountants, farmers and factory workers, and beyond.","606.1",NA
"Investment will be targeted at those who need it most,","403",NA
"including communities with high unemployment,","701",NA
"those excluded from full participation in the economy","503",NA
"and those dependent on old, energy guzzling, polluting industries.","416.2",NA
"We will work alongside trade unions to ensure a just transition to a green future,","701",NA
"which will leave no one behind.","503",NA
"Business will share collective responsibility for delivering the Green New Deal too and will be incentivised to lead the way by innovating and manufacturing a better future.","402",NA
"Businesses that are currently obliged to maximise returns to shareholders will need to take account of other stakeholders - including the ecosystem - and the impact of their activities on the climate and on communities.","416.2",NA
"Public sector investment to kick-start the Green New Deal will act as a catalyst for private sector investment,","402",NA
"as private investors seek to share in the financial rewards of the transition to a net zero carbon future.","416.2",NA
"The Green New Deal will give power and resources for devolved governments, elected mayors and local governments to transform the communities they represent.","301",NA
"Local people will be directly involved, actively engaging all of us in the future of the places where we live and work.","301",NA
"It will also mean new forms of common ownership throughout vital parts of our infrastructure, such as waterways,","413",NA
"buses,","413",NA
"parks","413",NA
"and railways.","413",NA
"We will create a new public banking infrastructure to help deliver our ambitious programme and the Green New Deal will ensure the banks invest and lend at low, affordable interest rates","403",NA
"to support the economy’s environmental transformation.","416.2",NA
"It will also deliver financial mechanisms and the transfer of new technologies to help the Global South adapt to climate change in a just way.","501",NA
"The Green New Deal will make space for nature, with policies to restore habitats in urban, suburban and countryside settings.","501",NA
"It will transform our food and farming system,","703.1",NA
"to improve human and environmental health,","501",NA
"maximise the landscape’s ability to store carbon and prevent flooding,","501",NA
"promote innovations in land management and ownership,","501",NA
"and ease the transition by protecting jobs and creating new green employment opportunities.","701",NA
"The wider economy will be transformed too, re-purposed to protect and enhance the wellbeing of citizens, society and the natural world.","416.2",NA
"Economic growth will no longer be the way we measure progress.","416.2",NA
"Instead, we will prioritise measures of real prosperity and wellbeing, like improvement in health,","416.2",NA
"reduction of inequality","416.2",NA
"and the restoration and protection of the natural environment on which we all depend.","416.2",NA
"The Green New Deal is also about fairness in a warming world.","501",NA
"Building on the Green Party’s commitment to global justice the Green New Deal includes finance and technology to help the majority world adapt to climate change and support human well-being,","501",NA
"breaking the carbon chains of fossil fuel dependence","416.2",NA
"and ending the economic culture that has viewed people and places primarily for the extraction of profit.","416.2",NA
"In short, the Green New Deal will unleash an urgently needed green economic and social revolution.","501",NA
"There is no time to lose - we must start now.","501",NA
"ELECTED GREENS DELIVERING",NA,NA
"Declaring a Climate Emergency",NA,NA
"In October 2018 the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published a landmark report warning of the urgent need for rapid and unprecedented change in all aspects of society to cut emissions in half in just 12 years.",NA,NA
"Green councillors in Bristol were the first very politicians in the UK to act in response. Weeks after the publication of the UN Report, Green Cllr Carla Denyer brought an urgent motion to Bristol City Council declaring a Climate Emergency and committing the Council to comprehensive action to make the city carbon neutral by 2030.",NA,NA
"The motion passed - and set off a cascade of others. Over 150 local authorities have now declared their own Climate Emergencies, along with the Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales. Green councillors and activists are now working to help those declaring emergencies to follow through on their promise of action, delivering radical action to halt the Climate Emergency from the ground up.",NA,NA
"Carla is the Green Party candidate for Bristol West in this General Election.",NA,NA
"In spring 2019 the Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, Caroline Lucas, sponsored an Early Day Motion highlighting the Climate Emergency, and welcomed environmental activist Greta Thunberg to Parliament. A few weeks after Greta addressed MPs on the need for action, Parliament itself declared a Climate Emergency. Caroline continues to work to ensure that warm words from MPs on tackling the Climate Emergency are followed through with meaningful action.",NA,NA
"From council chambers to Westminster, and in hundreds of places in between, Greens are leading the fight against climate chaos.",NA,NA
"This election is your chance to stand with us and put the Climate Emergency at the top of the political agenda.",NA,NA
"The Green New Deal for energy","H",NA
"The key to reducing our impact on the climate is to stop burning fossil fuels as soon as possible.","501",NA
"The UK has an abundance of the wind, tides, sun and rivers needed to be self-sufficient in energy - and it’s time for investment to unleash this potential and enable us leave oil and gas in the ground.","416.2",NA
"The Green New Deal will accelerate the transformation of our energy supply and create the energy infrastructure of the future - one powered by renewables - working in harmony with a reduction in energy demand.","416.2",NA
"With our renewable energy supply unlocked, we can hugely reduce fossil fuel use in our energy system,","416.2",NA
"and with it our reliance on nuclear power.","416.2",NA
"The Green New Deal for energy will revolutionise the way we produce and use energy.","416.2",NA
"It will: Enable communities to develop their own renewable energy projects, so that the benefits of locally generated energy can stay local.","606.1",NA
"Introduce new support and incentives to directly accelerate wind energy development,","402",NA
"paving the way for wind to provide around 70% of the UK’s electricity by 2030.","416.2",NA
"Introduce new support for solar, geothermal, tidal, hydro and other renewable energies to provide much of the remainder of the UK’s energy supply by 2030.","402",NA
"Transform the planning system so that it works to support a massive increase in wind power and other renewable generation.","403",NA
"Work with the Crown Estate, which owns much of the UK’s coastline, to open up more coastal waters for offshore wind and marine energy.","403",NA
"We will ensure that the long-term profits from these vital energy assets come to the UK government rather than energy firms.","412",NA
"Remove subsidies to the oil and gas industries.","416.2",NA
"Apply a Carbon Tax on all fossil fuel imports and domestic extraction, based on greenhouse gas emissions produced when fuel is burnt.","416.2",NA
"We will also apply a Carbon Tax on imported energy, based on its embedded emissions.","416.2",NA
"We will raise the Carbon Tax rate progressively over a decade, rendering coal, oil and gas financially unviable as cheaper renewable energies rise up to take their place.","416.2",NA
"Connect our electricity supply more closely to that of our neighbours in Europe, to provide a wider supply we can call on when needed","416.2",NA
"and to allow us to export electricity when we have a surplus.","416.2",NA
"Subsea connections to Norway and Iceland to connect to their hydro and geothermal power supplies will beparticularly encouraged.","416.2",NA
"Deploy demand side management and significantly expand and improve the efficiency of the electricity grid, doubling its capacity so that it can distribute the increased electricity the UK will need","409",NA
"as it transitions away from fossil fuels.","501",NA
"Expand our short-term capacity for energy storage so that electricity from peak periods of renewable electricity generation (e.g. days with very strong winds and many hours of sunshine) can be effectively stored","416.2",NA
"– utilising solutions such a domestic solar batteries,","416.2",NA
"storage as heat in hot water cylinders and thermal stores,","416.2",NA
"and smart control of vehicle battery charging.","416.2",NA
"Prohibit the construction of nuclear power stations.","416.2",NA
"We know that nuclear is a distraction from developing renewable energy,","416.2",NA
"carries an unacceptable risk for the communities living close to nuclear energy facilities,","416.2",NA
"creates unmanageable quantities of radioactive waste","416.2",NA
"and is inextricably linked with the production of world-destroying nuclear weapons.","416.2",NA
"Encourage greater energy efficiency across the economy,","501",NA
"including by providing energy efficiency training for businesses and public bodies,","411",NA
"emphasising the need for behavioural change - we all need to value energy as we value money.","501",NA
"Small businesses and co-ops will receive this training for free.","403",NA
"Ban fracking, and other unconventional forms of fossil fuel extraction, now and forever.","416.2",NA
"The Green New Deal for housing","H",NA
"Green New Deal investment in housing will simultaneously reduce climate emissions,","501",NA
"tackle fuel poverty","503",NA
"and provide genuinely affordable housing.","503",NA
"We will improve the insulation of every home in the UK, making sure they are all warm in winter.","501",NA
"This green homes revolution will make sure nobody is forced to choose between heating or eating.","503",NA
"Everyone should have a safe, affordable and warm place to call home.","503",NA
"We will end the housing crisis by creating enough affordable homes – including 100,0new council homes a year.","504",NA
"Our plans will also ensure that all new and renovated homes meet the highest possible standards and meet social needs.","503",NA
"Work on our homes, businesses and public buildings will create quality jobs in every part of the UK","701",NA
"as we shift to a net zero carbon economy.","501",NA
"Our Green New Deal for housing will: Empower local authorities to bring empty homes back into use","301",NA
"and create a total of 100,000 new homes for social rent (council homes) a year, built to the Passivhaus or equivalent standard.","504",NA
"This standard will see these new homes use 90% less energy for space heating than the average home, significantly reducing household bills.","501",NA
"Allocate funding to local authorities for council home creation based on the needs of their area.","301",NA
"We expect much of the need to be concentrated in areas where Green New Deal jobs will be created.","701",NA
"We will incentivise local authorities to spread small developments across their areas, rather than building huge new estates,","504",NA
"and to build, renovate and convert to high quality designs that respect local architectural heritage.","504",NA
"The new council homes will offer secure, lifetime tenancies.","504",NA
"Ensure all new developments will be located and designed to ensure that residents do not need cars to live a full life, either having safe pedestrian access to local shops and schools,","501",NA
"or are within 1km of a local rail, tube or tram station,","501",NA
"or 500m of a high frequency bus service.","501",NA
"Make energy efficiency and elimination fuel poverty a national infrastructure priority.","503",NA
"Improve the insulation of every UK home that needs more insulation by 2030.","501",NA
"The material used for these insulation improvements will be sustainable.","501",NA
"Significantly reduce heating bills by improving 1 million existing homes and other buildings a year, so that they reach the highest standard of energy efficiency (over and above the Energy Performance Certificate A rating).","501",NA
"Homes lived in by people on low incomes will be the first to receive these major improvements and benefit from reduced heating bills.","503",NA
"This will be a deep retrofitting of 10 million homes by 2030,","501",NA
"on top of the insulation improvements every home that needs it will receive.","501",NA
"Roll out solar panels and other forms of renewable domestic energy generation, giving 1 million households a year the means to generate a proportion of the energy they use.","501",NA
"This will mean that 10 million homes are able to generate their own renewable energy by 2030.","501",NA
"Reduce the use of natural gas for heating homes through a programme, to replace polluting boilers with renewable heat from heat pumps, and solar thermal, geothermal, biomass and stored heat technologies.","501",NA
"Insulate non domestic buildings, addressing the large amounts of energy lost from offices and public buildings.","501",NA
"Deploy heat networks to transport heat from the source of renewable heat to individual buildings in a district or neighbourhood.","501",NA
"Transform the planning system and building regulations, so that all new buildings built by private developers are built to the Passivhaus standard (or to a standard that delivers energy efficiency at an equivalent or better level).","501",NA
"We will enable self¬build development that meets the same standards.","501",NA
"Improve building regulations so that all renovations to roofs, external walls, windows and doors improve the energy performance of that part of the building to the equivalent of (or better than) an Energy Performance Certificate A rating.","501",NA
"We will reinstate the requirement for local council building control inspectors to carry out inspections themselves of new build properties and renovations to ensure this work is carried out to the required standards.","501",NA
"Ensure that all 8 million rented homes are A rated for energy efficiency, or as close to this as possible, by implementing a Minimum Energy Efficiency Standard escalator to raise the minimum level allowed from the current E rating to A rating by 2030.","403",NA
"Update the fire safety regulations relating to the use of all types of insulation in buildings.","403",NA
"Change the planning system to incentivise renovation, extension and improvement of existing buildings, rather than relying on new build,","402",NA
"to reduce the use of steel, concrete, cladding and finishes, which produce massive amounts of carbon in their manufacture.","501",NA
"Similarly we will incentivise the use of sustainable materials.","501",NA
"These reforms will integrate closely with the proposals set out in the ‘Delivering secure incomes and homes’ section on page 49.","501",NA
"The Green New Deal for transport","H",NA
"Our transport system is built on fossil fuels.","501",NA
"As well as destabilising our climate, this reliance traps us into stressful, unhealthy and expensive forms of travel.","501",NA
"Car dependency contributes to congestion, road danger and air pollution whilst reducing physical activity.","501",NA
"The Green New Deal will revolutionise our transport system by ending dependence on carbon,","411",NA
"and investing instead in alternatives that work for better for the climate and for people.","501",NA
"This means more reliable and affordable trains, electric buses and trams,","411",NA
"and better options for cycling and walking.","501",NA
"From new trains and targeted fare reductions, to rapidly expanding bike hire schemes, we think it’s time to transform the way the UK moves.","501",NA
"Our Green New Deal for transport will invest in public transport, walking and cycling so wherever people live they are not forced to use a car, by:","501",NA
"Spending £2.5 billion a year on new cycleways and footpaths,","411",NA
"built using sustainable materials, such as woodchips and sawdust.","501",NA
"Making travelling by public transport cheaper than travelling by car, by reducing the cost of travelling by train and bus.","501",NA
"Coach travel will also be encouraged, with new routes for electric coaches provided across the country.","411",NA
"Creating a new golden age of train by opening new rail connections that remove bottlenecks,","411",NA
"increase rail freight capacity,","411",NA
"improve journey times and frequencies,","411",NA
"enhance capacity in the South West, Midlands and North,","411",NA
"and connect currently unconnected urban areas.","411",NA
"We would also look, where possible, to re-open closed stations.","411",NA
"These rail improvements will benefit from funding switched from the damaging HS2 scheme, which we will cancel (see ‘Ending wasteful spending’ section below for more details).","416.2",NA
"Electrifying all railway lines that connect cities, improving punctuality.","411",NA
"Creating a government-owned rolling stock company which would invest in a fleet of new electric trains to run on newly electrified lines.","411",NA
"Giving responsibility for running short-distance passenger rail franchises to councils, or groups of councils that come together to work on local transport.","301",NA
"This will give local communities a greater say in the running of the rail services they rely on.","301",NA
"We will bring all railways back into public ownership over ten years.","413",NA
"Ensuring good railway connections with all ports to enable more freight between ports and inland terminals to be carried on rail.","411",NA
"We will invest in additional freight routes resulting in the majority of long-distance freight switching from road to rail.","501",NA
"Giving all local authorities control over bus services (as London currently has) and supporting local authorities to restore lost bus routes and open new ones.","301",NA
"Local authorities serving urban areas will be encouraged to explore tramways as an additional public transport option.","411",NA
"Providing more bus priority measures on the roads to improve punctuality.","501",NA
"Funding local authorities to improve the appearance and facilities of bus stops, bus stations and train stations, to make them more user friendly and convenient for both passengers and transport staff.","411",NA
"This includes the provision of more public toilets, and ensuring full accessibility for disabled people.","503",NA
"Apply a Carbon Tax on all fossil fuels, as outlined above in the ‘Green New Deal for energy’ section, which will increase the cost of petrol, diesel and shipping fuel, as well as on aviation fuel for domestic flights.","416.2",NA
"Domestic flights will also lose their VAT exemption","501",NA
"and there will be an additional surcharge on domestic aviation fuel to account for the increased warming effect of emissions release at altitude.","501",NA
"We will lobby against the international rules that prevent action being taken to tax international aviation fuel.","501",NA
"Ban advertising for flights,","501",NA
"and introduce a Frequent Flyer Levy to reduce the impact of the 15% of people who take 70% of flights.","501",NA
"This Frequent Flyer Levy only applies to people who take more than one (return) flight a year, discouraging excessive flying.","501",NA
"Stop the building of new runways and all increased road capacity, saving thousands of acres of countryside every year","416.2",NA
"and protecting people from the harm of increased air pollution and traffic danger.","501",NA
"End the sale of new petrol and diesel fuelled vehicles by 2030.","416.2",NA
"Over the next ten years we will ease this transition by incentivising the replacement of diesel and petrol vans, lorries and coaches with electric vehicles.","416.2",NA
"Our priority is reducing overall mileage and the number of vehicles on our roads","416.2",NA
"– these further measures will ensure that the vehicles still on our roads in 2030 create the minimum of pollution.","416.2",NA
"Even electric vehicles pollute, so they represent an improvement on the current situation, not a solution in themselves.","416.2",NA
"Create a network of electric vehicle charging points across the country, by requiring their construction through the planning system","416.2",NA
"and encouraging the private sector to deliver them.","402",NA
"We will ensure that these charging points are located in public places, and do not take up pavement and cycling space.","416.2",NA
"We will require all existing petrol stations and motorway service stations to offer electric vehicle charging points by 2025.","416.2",NA
"Civilise our streets by making Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (in which rat-running is blocked) the norm for residential areas","416.2",NA
"and making 20 miles per hour the default speed limit.","416.2",NA
"These changes would reduce traffic, carbon emissions and danger to people walking and cycling.","416.2",NA
"They would restore our streets to all people.","416.2",NA
"They would also form part of a wider commitment to the core principle of the Vision Zero campaign - that there should be no fatalities or serious injuries as a result of road traffic collisions.","416.2",NA
"Make 40 miles per hour the default speed limit in non-residential areas except on major roads.","416.2",NA
"Ensure through the planning system that all new housing is served by high quality walking and cycling routes and much improved bus, tram and local rail services.","416.2",NA
"New residents must not be forced into car use.","416.2",NA
"Incentivise changes to travelling behaviour by promoting more stay at home working","416.2",NA
"(with working hours’ heating, electricity and Wi-Fi costs reimbursed by employers for low income workers working from home),","701",NA
"more business teleconferencing,","416.2",NA
"more local work station hubs","416.2",NA
"and more car club schemes.","416.2",NA
"We will also encourage more domestic holiday travel, through removing VAT from UK hotel and holiday home stays and attractions.","416.2",NA
"The Green New Deal for industry","H",NA
"Green New Deal investment will rebalance industry, away from the carbon past and towards the renewable future.","416.2",NA
"New technologies, along with huge expansions in renewable energy, will create millions of new, good quality, well-paid, secure jobs in every corner of the country","701",NA
"- with training for these new jobs funded by the Green New Deal.","411",NA
"This unprecedented investment in training and skills will prioritise communities hit hard by economic changes over recent decades.","503",NA
"A circular economy will underpin this green industrial revolution, designing out waste and pollution,","501",NA

In 2017 Green Cllr Alison Teal was arrested with other residents trying to save trees earmarked for destruction.",NA,NA
"The Labour council took Alison and several residents to the High Court and had an injunction imposed to prevent them from protecting trees. Later the Labour council accused Alison of breaching the injunction and took her to the High Court to face a committal hearing.

"The streets of our cities are home to 4,000 rough sleepers.","503",NA
"Nurses are going to foodbanks to put dinner on the table.","503",NA
"We can do so much better than this.","503",NA
"It’s a question of political choices.","503",NA
"The rich are getting richer whilst everyone else struggles to make ends meet.","503",NA
"Talking about the problem isn’t enough - it’s time to act.","503",NA
"We will redistribute wealth and lift everyone up.","503",NA
"We want to enable people to build secure lives and livelihoods.","503",NA
"Alongside giving everyone a minimum level of security with a Universal Basic Income,","504",NA
"we will make our tax system fit for purpose - fairer and more effective at bringing in revenue for public services","504",NA
"and funding the Green New Deal.","501",NA
"We see tax as the primary way most of us contribute towards our own and the common good - a fair and valuable payment towards a well-functioning, just society that protects citizens","606.1",NA
"and the planet which sustains us.","501",NA
"We will simplify taxes, close tax loopholes and make sure everyone pays their fair share.","503",NA
"We will redesign the way property and land are taxed, shifting responsibility away from renters and business tenants and instead towards wealthy landowners who benefit the most.","403",NA
"We will redirect government spending away from wasteful vanity projects, and towards enabling people to build the lives they want to lead.","503",NA
"Above all, we will transform our tax system, so it is able to generate the funds needed to deliver good public services","504",NA
"and the Green New Deal, and deliver ongoing economic, climate and social justice.","501",NA
"Simplifying income taxes","H",NA
"Our current system of income taxes is hugely complex.","303",NA
"Those seeking to avoid tax are able to use this complexity to their advantage.","503",NA
"Tax avoiders can shift their money in and out of different income and asset categories, switching category just before the tax official catches up with them.","503",NA
"A whole tax avoidance industry exists to guide those prepared to pay to wriggle out of tax through the cracks in the system.","503",NA
"This charade keeps billions of pounds out of the public purse every year, money that could be spent on new homes, schools and hospitals.","504",NA
"It’s time to straighten out the tax system, so that tax avoiders can no longer evade their responsibilities,","503",NA
"and so that income from wealth is taxed the same as income from work.","503",NA
"This will ensure that the wealthiest pay their fair share.","503",NA
"Our Green plan to simplify tax will shine a light on the corners of the economy where the richest stash their wealth.","503",NA
"We will: Merge Employees National Insurance, Capital Gains Tax, Inheritance Tax, Dividend Tax and Income Tax into a single Consolidated Income Tax.","503",NA
"This closing of loopholes will bring in an estimated £20 billion extra per year into the public purse.","504",NA
"It will mean that all income is treated the same way for tax purposes.","503",NA
"Tax income from investments/ assets at the same level as the taxation of income from work, through the Consolidated Income Tax.","503",NA
"This will end the injustice whereby people who work for their incomes are taxed more highly than those whose income is derived from wealth.","503",NA
"Replace the Income Tax threshold with Universal Basic Income.","504",NA
"End the double taxation of pension funds, which are currently subject to Corporation Tax and then Income Tax when paid out to individual pensioners.","504",NA
"Reforming property taxes","H",NA
"The Green Party wants to transform land and property taxes.","503",NA
"Half of England is owned by less than 1% of its population.","503",NA
"Our tax system allows landlords to sit on land and do nothing whilst public money for enhancements sees land value increase.","503",NA
"Council Tax is failing too.","503",NA
"It is one of the main ways of taxing wealth, yet bands are still based on valuations from 1991.","503",NA
"This means someone in a multi-million pound property pays a far lower proportion of tax than someone in a one-bedroom flat.","503",NA
"All the while, small and independent businesses are crying out for reform of the unfair business rates system,","402",NA
"and young people face a lifetime of housing insecurity and high prices.","503",NA
"It’s time for change.","503",NA
"Over the long term we will take steps to replace the current unjust, out-of¬date system with a Land Value Tax (LVT), designed to redistribute wealth","503",NA
"and help fix our broken housing market.","403",NA
"LVT will be a single tax (replacing the multiple taxes that currently exist) which will capture the real value of land, and the increased value arising from improvements to it.","503",NA
"Winston Churchill backed an LVT, arguing that the value added to a property because of improvements, like transport infrastructure, paid for by the public purse, should be returned to the community.","503",NA
"The many other benefits include bringing more brownfield sites into use;","416.2",NA
"discouraging speculative land banking;","416.2",NA
"and more efficient, sustainable use of land.","416.2",NA
"LVT will help stabilise the property market and shift the burden of taxation from land users, including renters and business tenants, to wealthy landowners.","503",NA
"It’s a critical part of how to tackle the housing crisis.","503",NA
"Our Green plan to transform land and property taxes will: Abolish Council Tax and Business Rates, replacing them with an LVT.","503",NA
"The LVT will also absorb National Non-domestic Rates, Stamp Duty on Land, Annual Tax on Enveloped Dwellings, Capital Gains Tax on land sales, Inheritance Tax on land and Income Tax on land for owner- occupiers.","503",NA
"The new LVT will charge the landowner a proportion of the capital value of the land each year (estimated to be around 1.4% of current values).","403",NA
"Ensure LVT is paid by landowners regardless of whether or not they live on the land.","403",NA
"This will incentivise those who own empty properties to release them back into the housing market.","402",NA
"Lift millions of renters and business tenants out of property taxes altogether, by shifting the burden of land taxation from land users to landowners.","403",NA
"We will legislate to prevent landowners passing these tax costs back to renters and tenants.","403",NA
"Phase in the changes over ten years, with reliefs on offer.","403",NA
"This will ensure that the vast majority of homeowners will face similar or lower levels of tax to that which they pay now.","403",NA
"Protect those who have low incomes but who are ‘land rich’ with a right to defer the tax until the property is sold or transferred.","403",NA
"Likewise, pensioners who are homeowners will be enabled to ‘roll over’ LVT payments until their property is sold, so they don’t feel undue pressure to move.","403",NA
"In the long term, the new LVT will bring in more money for the public purse.","303",NA
"However due to the phased introduction of the policy, and the reliefs we will offer to help homeowners transition to the new system, we estimate that the LVT will be revenue neutral for the first ten years (bringing in the same amount of revenue as the taxes it replaces).","403",NA
"Making big business pay its fair","H",NA
"In a transformed green economy we will need to harness the power and influence of businesses to do good.","416.2",NA
"At the moment, huge corporations tend to use their power to generate profit for a small number of people and to reduce the amount of tax they pay.","403",NA
"We think it’s time to straighten things out, so nobody can abuse the tax system and dodge their responsibilities.","403",NA
"When Corporation Tax was first introduced to the UK in 1965, it stood at 40%. Now it’s at 19%, one of the lowest in Europe.","403",NA
"And overseas giants like Amazon and Google exploit tax loopholes to pay even less.","403",NA
"Businesses can be the bedrock of an economy that enables us all to thrive, if they pay what they owe and invest in the public services and infrastructure from which they benefit.","403",NA
"Our plan for tax justice Increase the rate of Corporation Tax to 24%, in line with the Organisation for Economic Co¬operation and Development (OECD) average.","403",NA
"We will advocate public country-by-country reporting and consolidated Corporate Tax across the EU to prevent profit shifting","108",NA
"Increase the Bank Asset Tax.","403",NA
"This will counteract the huge levels of support previous governments have given the banking sector, through public protections, licenses and subsidies.","403",NA
"We will also close a loophole in the Stamp Duty on Shares, by including share purchases of all values and new share issues within the Duty.","403",NA
"Establish HM Revenue & Customs as an independent agency of government, answerable to Parliament.","303",NA
"This will remove the power of politicians to strike secret deals with powerful corporations and individuals.","304",NA
"Entrench the anti-avoidance principle in UK tax law and oblige banks to provide information about companies automatically to HMRC.","403",NA

"We have set out our spending over ten years, in line with our proposed ten- year Green New Deal to put us on track to reducing our carbon emissions to zero by 2030. This extended time period reflects the scale of the change needed to fix our climate and fund our future.

The cost of government borrowing is at its lowest for decades, creating an unparalleled opportunity for public investment.",NA,NA
"We feel that this borrowing to invest is justified, in the face of the looming Climate Emergency, and prudent, given how Green New Deal investment will kick-start an economic and social regeneration. The proceeds of this investment will in time mean that the Green New Deal pays for itself.",NA,NA
"The rate of the Carbon Tax will rise through the Green New Deal period, with the reducing amounts of carbon in the economy taxed at an accelerating rate to encourage further phasing out.",NA,NA
"At the end of the Green New Deal period the extra revenue from the jobs, rented homes and transport assets created by New Deal investment will make themselves felt - replacing Carbon Tax revenue in the long term and providing a healthy surplus.
