"international solidarity","107",NA
"and greater democratic accountability.","202.1",NA

"Brexit is a consequence of that.","108",NA
"Brexit is not the answer.","108",NA
"Brexit will have a detrimental impact on the Good Friday Agreement and the principles of the peace process","106",NA

"The alternative to Brexit is designated special status for the North within the European Union.","108",NA
"This can be done within the current constitutional arrangement.","108",NA
"The only other way to prevent Brexit is through a United Ireland","301",NA

"A strong vote for Sinn Féin in this election will strengthen that demand and advance the imperative of ending partition and for reunification.","301",NA

"They have pursued a policy of tax cuts for the rich while the poorest have had their benefits cut.","503",NA
"Despite the Tory cuts, Sinn Féin has sought to protect front-line services and to defend the most vulnerable in our society.","504",NA
"However, the Tory’s tax and cuts agenda continues to increase poverty","504",NA

"and delivering for all with equality and respect.","503",NA
"The Executive could be re-established tomorrow if the Tory party and the DUP lived up to their responsibilities.","305.1",NA

"BREXIT AND FDI","H",NA
"Offering access to the single market is key to our attraction as a location for inward investment, particularly in higher-skilled and higher-paid sectors.","408",NA
