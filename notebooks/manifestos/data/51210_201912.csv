"people's jobs and livelihoods,","701",NA
"and your rights and entitlements currently enjoyed as lrish and EU citizens.","602.1",NA
"Since then the Tories and the DUP have ignored your views.","305.1",NA
"The dominant voice in the Tory party has been of right-wing English nationalism.","602.1",NA
"They have disregarded the voices of citizens in Scotland and the north of Ireland to remain.","108",NA
"But the game is far from over.","108",NA
"Your vote for remain candidates in this election is again about sending a message about which union you want to belong to; Ireland in Europe or Britain.","108",NA
"For three years the Tory/DUP desire for a Brexit at any cost has led us to the verge of crashing out of the EU without a deal","108",NA
"and a reintroduction of a hard border on our island.","602.1",NA
"This threat has not disappeared.","602.1",NA
"But there is a solution that allows us to ensure that we do not have a hard border, with all the political and financial consequences that would flow from that.","602.1",NA
"A solution that frees us up to shape our own political destiny,","602.1",NA
"free from the diktats of right-wing English nationalism.","602.1",NA
"That solution is contained within the Good Friday Agreement- the creation of a new, agreed and united Ireland - an inclusive society.","602.1",NA
"Spurious arguments that this is not the time for such a democratic exercise miss the fact that the discussion about our futureislive and growing.","202.1",NA

"The then Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, when he first went to Brussels talked about Scotland and didn't mention the North of lreland.","108",NA

"We have worked closely with Border Communities Against Brexit (BCAB).","108",NA
"Their public profile and publicity provided them the space to influence.","108",NA

"We engaged with the British Government directly.","202.1",NA
"We continue to do so.","202.1",NA

"ln an ever increasingly globalised world - our constituents are sawy enough to understand that political representation is about having a voice strong enough to be heard in the corridors of power throughout the world - from Capitol Hili in America, Downing Street in London, the Dail in Dublin and Brussels -","202.1",NA
"Sinn Fein is the only political party that can offer that active, robust representation where it matters.","202.1",NA
