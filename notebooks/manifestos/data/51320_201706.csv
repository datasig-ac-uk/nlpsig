"CREATING AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR ALL","H",NA
"Labour’s economic strategy is about delivering a fairer, more prosperous society for the many, not just the few.","503",NA
"We will measure our economic success not by the number of billionaires, but by the ability of our people to live richer lives.","503",NA
"Labour understands that the creation of wealth is a collective endeavour between workers, entrepreneurs, investors and government.","405",NA
"Each contributes and each must share fairly in the rewards.","503",NA
"This manifesto sets out Labour’s plan to upgrade our economy and rewrite the rules of a rigged system, so that our economy really works for the many, and not only the few.","503",NA
"Britain is the only major developed economy where earnings have fallen even as growth has returned after the financial crisis.","701",NA
"Most working people in Britain today are earning less, after inflation, than they did ten years ago.","701",NA
"Too many of us are in low-paid and insecure work.","701",NA
"Too many of us fear our children will not enjoy the same opportunities that we have.","503",NA
"Labour will turn this around.","503",NA
"We will upgrade our economy, breaking down the barriers that hold too many of us back,","503",NA
"and tackling the gender pay gap.","503",NA
"Our National Transformation Fund will deliver the investment that every part of Britain needs to meet its potential, overcoming years of neglect.","411",NA
"Our industrial strategy will support businesses to create new, highskilled, high-paid and secure work across the country, in the sectors of the future such as renewables.","411",NA
"We will stop our financial system being rigged for the few, turning the power of finance to work for the public good.","503",NA
"And we will put small businesses at the centre of our economic strategy.","402",NA
"The growth created by our national investment plan, underpinned by the responsible economic management embodied in our Fiscal Credibility Rule, will create good jobs,","701",NA
"drive up living standards","410",NA
"and improve the public finances.","414",NA
"It is a plan that will deliver Labour’s vision of an economy that works for the many, not just the few","503",NA
"– a Britain in which no one is held back.","503",NA
"A FAIR TAXATION SYSTEM","H",NA
"Taxation is what underpins our shared prosperity.","503",NA
"All of us, including business, benefit from a healthy, educated and skilled population, with access to basic services and secure housing.","503",NA
"We believe in the social obligation to contribute to a fair taxation scheme for the common good.","503",NA
"We will take on the social scourge of tax avoidance through our Tax Transparency and Enforcement Programme,","503",NA
"and close down tax loopholes.","503",NA
"But we will not ask ordinary households to pay more.","701",NA
"A Labour government will guarantee no rises in income tax for those earning below £80,000 a year,","704",NA
"and no increases in personal National Insurance Contributions or the rate of VAT.","704",NA
"Under Labour’s plans, 95 per cent of taxpayers will be guaranteed no increase in their income tax contributions, and everyone will be protected from any increase in personal National Insurance contributions and VAT.","704",NA
"Only the top 5 per cent of earners will be asked to contribute more in tax to help fund our public services.","503",NA
"We renew our pledge not to extend VAT to food, children’s clothes, books and newspapers, and public transport fares.","504",NA
"Corporation tax in the UK is the lowest of any major developed economy.","503",NA
"Our new settlement with business will ask large corporations to pay a little more while still keeping UK corporation tax among the lowest of the major developed economies.","503",NA
"In turn, we will meet the business need for a more skilled workforce with extra corporate tax revenues while contributing to education and skills budgets.","411",NA
"We will protect small businesses by reintroducing the lower small profits rate of corporation tax.","402",NA
"We will also exclude small businesses from costly plans to introduce quarterly reporting","402",NA
"and take action on late payments.","403",NA
"Labour will give HM Revenue & Customs the resources and skills necessary to clamp down hard on those unscrupulous few individuals and companies who seek to avoid the responsibilities that the rest of us meet.","503",NA
"BALANCING THE BOOKS","H",NA
"Our manifesto is fully costed, with all current spending paid for out of taxation or redirected revenue streams.","414",NA
"Our public services must rest on the foundation of sound finances.","414",NA
"Labour will therefore set the target of eliminating the government’s deficit on day-to-day spending within five years.","414",NA
"But government must have a laserlike focus on how we earn, as well as how we spend.","410",NA
"At the same time as eliminating the current deficit, Labour will invest in our future, to ensure faster growth and help us to earn our way as a country again.","410",NA
"To maintain good fiscal health, we will have a firm rule in place to guide all our taxation and spending decisions.","414",NA
"Our Fiscal Credibility Rule is based on the simple principle that government should not be borrowing for day-today spending,","414",NA
"but that future growth depends on investment.","402",NA
"It was designed in conjunction with worldleading economists.","414",NA
"It also means we are committed to ensuring that the national debt is lower at the end of the next Parliament than it is today.","414",NA
"Compliance with the rule will be overseen by a strengthened and truly independent Office for Budget Responsibility, which we will make accountable to Parliament.","202.1",NA
"We will also consult on implementing the recommendations of the Kerslake Review of the Treasury.","408",NA
"INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT","H",NA
"Our country and its people have been held back by a lack of investment in the backbone of a modern economy – the infrastructure of transport, communications and energy systems.","411",NA
"And when investment has happened, it has been too concentrated in too few places.","411",NA
"Labour will make different choices.","411",NA
"We will take advantage of near- record low interest rates to create a National Transformation Fund that will invest £250 billion over ten years in upgrading our economy.","411",NA
"We will ensure that the huge potential of every part of our country is met.","503",NA
"The next Labour government will rebuild communities ripped apart by globalisation and neglected for years by government.","606.1",NA
"We will rebuild and transform our economy so that it works for the many, not the few.","503",NA
"So we will put in place tight rules to ensure that investment is fairly shared around every region and nation of the UK.","503",NA
"We will tear down the barriers that have held too many people back.","503",NA
"A Labour government will complete the HS2 high-speed rail line from London through Birmingham to Leeds and Manchester, and then into Scotland, consulting with (and, where necessary, compensating) communities.","411",NA
"We will link HS2 with other rail investments, such as Crossrail of the North (tying together our great northern cities) and on to the Durham Freight Centre.","411",NA
"We will build a new Brighton Main Line for the South East.","411",NA
"In London, to ensure our capital continues to prosper, we will build Crossrail 2.","411",NA
"To harness the economic potential of new technologies and science, we will complete the Science Vale transport arc, from Oxford to Cambridge through Milton Keynes.","411",NA
"And we will deliver rail electrification and expansion across the whole country, including Wales and the South West.","411",NA
"We will transform our energy systems, investing in new, stateof-the-art low-carbon gas and renewable electricity production.","411",NA
"We will deliver universal superfast broadband availability by 2022.","411",NA
"Labour will improve mobile internet coverage and expand provision of free public wi-fi in city centres and on public transport.","411",NA
"We will improve 4G coverage and invest to ensure all urban areas, as well as major roads and railways, have uninterrupted 5G coverage.","411",NA
"On day one we will instruct the National Infrastructure Commission to report on how to roll out'ultrafast’ (300Mbps) across the UK within the next decade.","411",NA
"UPGRADING OUR ECONOMY: LABOUR’S INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY","H",NA
"Our economy is suffering from years of neglect by governments that have refused to support our industries, businesses and workers.","408",NA
"This wasted potential is holding us all back.","410",NA
"Inequality has ballooned as the economy has shifted towards low-paid, insecure jobs.","503",NA
"Britain’s manufacturing base has declined","410",NA
"and we have relied too heavily on the financial sector, centred on London and the South East.","503",NA
"And while the South East struggles with a rising cost of living crisis, many northern and coastal towns have watched as their economies and communities are left behind.","503",NA
"Britain’s failure to get all its regional and local economies working can be seen in the deterioration of the country’s current account,","414",NA
"weak productivity growth","410",NA
"and underinvestment in infrastructure.","411",NA
"Britain can only be stronger if every nation and region is given the resources and support to succeed.","301",NA
"Only a Labour government with a credible industrial strategy can reach this untapped potential and deliver prosperity to every corner of our country, working with devolved administrations.","301",NA
"Our industrial strategy will be built on objective, measurable missions designed to address the great challenges of our times.","411",NA
"In meeting these challenges, we will move beyond the narrow approaches of the past, and mobilise the talents and resources of our whole country to deliver an economy fit for the future.","411",NA
"The first missions set by a Labour government will be to: ensure that 60 per cent of the UK’s energy comes from zero-carbon or renewable sources by 2030","501",NA
"create an innovation nation with the highest proportion of highskilled jobs in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development by 2030.","411",NA
"We will meet the OECD target of 3 per cent of GDP spent on research and development by 2030.","411",NA
"In order to create a fertile ground for businesses to achieve these missions Labour will take action across the areas we know are necessary for business and industry to grow:","410",NA
"Skills - by creating a National Education Service for England.","411",NA
"Infrastructure – by investing £250 billion over the next ten years.","411",NA
"UK supply chains - by targeting government support where there are gaps.","403",NA
"Trade – by negotiating a new deal with Europe that puts jobs and the economy first.","407",NA
"Procurement – by requiring the best standards on government contracts.","303",NA
"Research and development – by committing extra research investment.","411",NA
"Energy costs and security – by capping costs","412",NA
"and investing in new publicly owned energy provision.","413",NA
"While our industrial strategy is one for growth across all sectors, Labour recognises that certain sectors are of strategic significance to the UK economy.","410",NA
"For each strategic industry, the next Labour government will establish a council (modelled on the highly successful Automotive Council) to oversee its future security and growth.","404",NA
"We will also encourage private investment by removing new plant and machinery from business rate calculations.","402",NA
"National and local government spends £200 billion a year in the privatesector procurement.","303",NA
"Labour will put that spending power to good use to upgrade our economy,","411",NA
"create good local jobs","701",NA
"and reduce inequality.","503",NA
"We will require firms supplying national or local government to meet the high standards we should expect of all businesses: paying their taxes,","503",NA
"recognising trade unions,","701",NA
"respecting workers’ rights and equal opportunities,","701",NA
"protecting the environment,","501",NA
"providing training,","411",NA
"and paying suppliers on time.","403",NA
"We will expect suppliers to reduce boardroom pay excesses by moving towards a 20:1 gap between the highest and lowest paid.","503",NA
"We will appoint a Digital Ambassador to liaise with technology companies to promote Britain as an attractive place for investment and provide support for start-ups to scale up to become world-class digital businesses.","411",NA
"Our Digital Ambassador will help to ensure businesses are ready to grow and prosper in the digital age.","411",NA
"TRANSFORMING OUR FINANCIAL SYSTEM","H",NA
"A decade after the devastating international financial crisis, our financial system is still holding back too many of our small businesses and local economies.","403",NA
"Labour will transform how our financial system operates.","408",NA
"Following the successful example of Germany and the Nordic countries, we will establish a National Investment Bank that will bring in private capital finance to deliver £250 billion of lending power.","413",NA
"This new public institution will support a network of regional development banks that, unlike giant City of London firms, will be dedicated to supporting inclusive growth in their communities.","416.2",NA
"The banks will deliver the finance that our small businesses, co-operatives and innovative projects need across the whole country.","403",NA
"The National Investment Bank will fill existing gaps in lending by private banks, particularly to small businesses,","402",NA
"and by providing patient, long-term finance to R&D-intensive investments.","404",NA
"It will also be given the task of helping to deliver our industrial strategy, by prioritising spending in line with its objectives.","411",NA
"Labour will overhaul the regulation of our financial system,","412",NA
"putting in place a firm ring-fence between investment and retail banking that will protect consumers.","403",NA
"We will take a new approach to the publicly-owned RBS, and launch a consultation on breaking up the bank to create new local public banks that are better matched to their customers’ needs.","412",NA
"And we will extend existing Stamp Duty Reserve Tax to cover a wider range of assets, ensuring that the public gets a fairer share of financial system profits.","503",NA
"Labour will change the law so that banks can’t close a branch where there is a clear local need, putting their customers first.","403",NA
"Britain has a successful international finance industry, but we also need a strong, safe and socially useful banking system to meet the needs of our own regional economies and communities.","416.2",NA
"We will commit to creating a more diverse banking system, backed up by legislation.","403",NA
"A NEW DEAL FOR BUSINESS","H",NA
"The majority of businesses play by the rules: they pay their taxes and their workers reasonably and on time, and they operate with respect for the environment and local communities.","416.2",NA
"That is why it is vital that government ensures that businesses doing the right thing are rewarded rather than undercut or outbid by those unscrupulous few that cut corners, whether on taxes, workers’ conditions, environmental standards, or consumer safety and protection.","416.2",NA
"But our business culture doesn’t always work like this.","416.2",NA
"Scandals such as the failure of BHS show how the longterm growth of a company can be sacrificed for the sake of a quick buck.","416.2",NA
"When shareholders are looking for quick short-term returns, they encourage companies to cut corners.","416.2",NA
"That means they look to cut wages, instead of investing for the long term, or they spend longer inventing new tax avoidance schemes than they do inventing new products.","416.2",NA
"By reforming the rules our companies operate under, we can make sure they stay focused on delivering shared wealth.","503",NA
"Labour will amend company law so that directors owe a duty directly not only shareholders, but to employees, customers, the environment and the wider public, and we will consult on bringing forward appropriate legislation within this Parliament.","416.2",NA
"Labour will amend the takeover regime to ensure that businesses identified as being'systemically important’ have a clear plan in place to protect workers and pensioners when a company is taken over.","403",NA
"Labour will also legislate to reduce pay inequality by introducing an Excessive Pay Levy on companies with staff on very high pay.","503",NA
"Our small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of our economy, providing 60 per cent of private-sector jobs.","402",NA
"Technological changes, like the spread of digital manufacturing and rapid communication, mean smaller, faster businesses will be the future of our economy.","402",NA
"Yet this Conservative Government has taken small businesses for granted.","402",NA
"Labour is the party of small businesses.","402",NA
"We understand the challenges our smaller businesses face.","402",NA
"In order to provide the support many small businesses need, a Labour government will: Mandate the new National Investment Bank, and regional development banks in every region, to identify where other lenders fail to meet the needs of SMEs and prioritise lending to improve the funding gap.","402",NA
"Reinstate the lower small-business corporation tax rate.","402",NA
"Introduce a package of reforms to business rates – including switching from RPI to CPI indexation,","402",NA
"exempting new investment in plant and machinery from valuations,","402",NA
"and ensuring that businesses have access to a proper appeals process","402",NA
"– while reviewing the entire business rates system in the longer run.","402",NA
"Scrap quarterly reporting for businesses with a turnover of under £85,000.","402",NA
"Declare war on late payments by: Using government procurement to ensure that anyone bidding for a government contract pays its own suppliers within 30 days.","403",NA
"Developing a version of the Australian system of binding arbitration and fines for persistent late-payers for the private and public sectors.","403",NA
"We will also bring forward legislation to create a proper legal definition for co-operative ownership.","403",NA
"The National Investment Bank and regional development banks will be charged with helping support our co-operative sector.","404",NA
"Labour will aim to double the size of the co-operative sector in the UK, putting it on a par with those in leading economies like Germany or the US.","404",NA
"WIDENING OWNERSHIP OF OUR ECONOMY","H",NA
"Britain is a long-established democracy.","202.1",NA
"But the distribution of ownership of the country’s economy means that decisions about our economy are often made by a narrow elite.","202.1",NA
"More democratic ownership structures would help our economy deliver for the many and lead to a fairer distribution of wealth.","503",NA
"In government, Labour would give more people a stake – and a say -  in our economy by doubling the size of the co-operative sector and introducing a “right to own,” making employees the buyer of first refusal when the company they work for is up for sale.","202.1",NA
"We will act to ‘insource’ our public and local council services as preferred providers.","413",NA
"Many basic goods and services have been taken out of democratic control through privatisation.","413",NA
"This has often led to higher prices and poorer quality, as prices are raised to pay out dividends.","413",NA
"For example, water bills have increased 40 per cent since privatisation, and our private energy providers overcharged customers by £2 billion in 2015.","413",NA
"In private hands, Royal Mail has increased stamp and parcel charges, and failed to meet its customer service obligations, while its owners trade shares at significant profit.","413",NA
"The Conservative Government’s privatisation of Royal Mail was a historic mistake, selling off another national asset on the cheap.","413",NA
"Across the world, countries are taking public utilities back into public ownership.","413",NA
"Labour will learn from these experiences and bring key utilities back into public ownership to deliver lower prices, more accountability and a more sustainable economy.","413",NA
"We will: Bring private rail companies back into public ownership as their franchises expire.","413",NA
"Regain control of energy supply networks through the alteration of operator license conditions, and transition to a publicly owned, decentralised energy system.","413",NA
"Replace our dysfunctional water system with a network of regional publicly-owned water companies.","413",NA
"Reverse the privatisation of Royal Mail at the earliest opportunity.","413",NA
"Public ownership will benefit consumers, ensuring that their interests are put first and that there is democratic accountability for the service.","413",NA
"SUSTAINABLE ENERGY","H",NA
"Labour’s energy policy is built on three simple principles: ·To ensure security of energy supply and ‘keep the lights on’.","411",NA
"To ensure energy costs are affordable for consumers and businesses.","412",NA
"To ensure we meet our climate change targets and transition to a low-carbon economy.","501",NA
"The UK energy system is outdated, expensive and polluting.","411",NA
"Privatisation has failed to deliver an energy system that delivers for people, businesses or our environment.","413",NA
"One in ten households are in fuel poverty, yet the Competition Markets Authority found customers are overcharged an enormous £2 billion every year.","412",NA
"Labour understands that many people don’t have time to shop around, they just want reliable and affordable energy.","412",NA
"So the next Labour Government will: ·Introduce an immediate emergency price cap to ensure that the average dual-fuel household energy bill remains below £1,000 per year, while we transition to a fairer system for bill payers.","412",NA
"Take energy back into public ownership to deliver renewable energy, affordability for consumers, and democratic control.","413",NA
"We will do this in the following stages: · Regaining control of energy supply networks through the alteration of the National and Regional Network Operator license conditions.","413",NA
"Supporting the creation of publicly owned, locally accountable energy companies and co-operatives to rival existing private energy suppliers, with at least one if every region.","413",NA
"Legislating to permit publicly owned local companies to purchase the regional grid infrastructure,","413",NA
"and to ensure that national and regional grid infrastructure is brought into public ownership over time.","413",NA
"Labour will insulate four million homes as an infrastructure priority to help those who suffer in cold homes each winter.","411",NA
"This will cut emissions,","501",NA
"improve health,","504",NA
"save on bills,","504",NA
"and reduce fuel poverty and winter deaths.","504",NA
"Homeowners will be offered interestfree loans to improve their property.","411",NA
"For renters, Labour will improve on existing Landlord Energy Efficiency regulations and re-establish the Landlord Energy Saving Allowance to encourage the uptake of efficiency measures.","411",NA
"Labour will ban fracking because it would lock us into an energy infrastructure based on fossil fuels, long after the point in 2030 when the Committee on Climate Change says gas in the UK must sharply decline.","501",NA
"Emerging technologies such as carbon capture and storage will help to smooth the transition to cleaner fuels","501",NA
"and to protect existing Jobs as part of the future energy mix.","701",NA
"To safeguard the offshore oil and gas industry, we will provide a strategy focused on protecting vital North Sea assets, and thejobs and skills that depend on them.","411",NA
"We are committed to renewable energy projects, including tidal lagoons, which can help create manufacturing and energy jobs","701",NA
"as well as contributing to climatechange commitments.","501",NA
"The UK has the world’s oldest nuclear industry, and nuclear will continue to be part of the UK energy supply.","411",NA
"We will support further nuclear projects and protect nuclear workers’ Jobs and pensions.","701",NA
"There are considerable opportunities for nuclear power and decommissioning both internationally and domestically.","411",NA
"Building a clean economy of the future is the most important thing we must do for our children, our grandchildren and future generations.","501",NA
"Yet recent years have seen a failure to progress towards our targets.","501",NA
"A Labour government will put us back on track to meet the targets in the Climate Change Act and the Paris Agreement.","501",NA
"The low-carbon economy is one of the UK’s fastest-growing sectors, creating jobs and providing investment across each region.","411",NA
"It employed an estimated 447,000 employees in the UK in 2015 and saw over £77 billion in turnover.","411",NA
"With backing from a Labour government, these sectors can secure crucial shares of global export markets.","411",NA
"Currently, the UK buys and sells energy tariff free from Europe, an arrangement which saves families and businesses money, and helps balance the power grid.","407",NA
"As part of the Brexit negotiations, Labour will prioritise maintaining access to the internal energy market.","407",NA
"Labour will also retain access to Euratom, to allow continued trade of fissile material, with access and collaboration over research vital to our nuclear industry.","411",NA
"NEGOTIATING BREXIT","H",NA
"Labour accepts the referendum result","110",NA
"and a Labour government will put the national interest first.","601.1",NA
"We will prioritise jobs and living standards,","701",NA
"build a close new relationship with the EU,","108",NA
"protect workers’ rights","701",NA
"and environmental standards,","501",NA
"provide certainty to EU nationals","108",NA
"and give a meaningful role to Parliament throughout negotiations.","202.1",NA
"We will end Theresa May’s reckless approach to Brexit,","305.2",NA
"and seek to unite the country around a Brexit deal that works for every community in Britain.","606.1",NA
"We will scrap the Conservatives’ Brexit White Paper and replace it with fresh negotiating priorities that have a strong emphasis on retaining the benefits of the Single Market and the Customs Union – which are essential for maintaining industries, jobs and businesses in Britain.","108",NA
"Labour will always put jobs and the economy first.","701",NA
"A Labour government will immediately guarantee existing rights for all EU nationals living in Britain and secure reciprocal rights for UK citizens who have chosen to make their lives in EU countries.","108",NA
"EU nationals do not just contribute to our society: they are part of our society.","108",NA
"And they should not be used as bargaining chips.","108",NA
"It is shameful that the Prime Minister rejected repeated attempts by Labour to resolve this issue before Article 50 was triggered.","305.2",NA
"As a result three million EU nationals have suffered unnecessary uncertainty, as have the 1.2 million UK citizens living in the EU.","108",NA
"A Conservative Brexit will weaken workers’ rights,","701",NA
"deregulate the economy,","403",NA
"slash corporate taxes,","503",NA
"sideline Parliament and democratic accountability,","202.1",NA
"and cut Britain off from our closest allies and most important trading partners.","108",NA
"Labour recognises that leaving the EU with ‘no deal’ is the worst possible deal for Britain and that it would do damage to our economy and trade.","108",NA
"We will reject ‘no deal’ as a viable option and if needs be negotiate transitional arrangements to avoid a 'cliff-edge’ for the UK economy.","108",NA
"The issues that affect our continent now will continue to do so in the future – and Labour will continue to work constructively with the EU and other European nations on issues such as climate change, refugee crises and counter-terrorism.","108",NA
"We will build a close co-operative future relationship with the EU, not as members but as partners.","108",NA
"A Labour government will ensure that the UK maintains our leading research role by seeking to stay part of Horizon 2020 and its successor programmes and by welcoming research staff to the UK.","108",NA
"We will seek to maintain membership of (or equivalent relationships with) European organisations which offer benefits to the UK such as Euratom and the European Medicines Agency.","108",NA
"We will seek to ensure that Britain remains part of the Erasmus scheme so that British students have the same educational opportunities after we leave the EU.","108",NA
"The EU is the UK’s single largest trading partner in agricultural produce, with the vast majority of British exports being sold to European markets.","703.1",NA
"A Labour government will end the uncertainty for our farmers and food producers by securing continued EU market access allowing British farmers and food producers to continue to sell their products on the Continent.","703.1",NA
"Labour will also protect our farmers and rural economy by ensuring Britain continues to set the highest standards in food quality and welfare.","703.1",NA
"We will not allow Brexit to be used as an excuse to undercut our farmers and flood Britain’s food chain with cheap and inferior produce.","703.1",NA
"We will drop the Conservatives’ Great Repeal Bill, replacing it with an EU Rights and Protections Bill that will ensure there is no detrimental change to workers’ rights,","701",NA
"equality law,","503",NA
"consumer rights","403",NA
"or environmental protections as a result of Brexit.","501",NA
"Throughout the Brexit process, we will make sure that all EU-derived laws that are of benefit - including workplace laws, consumer rights and environmental protections – are fully protected without qualifications, limitations or sunset clauses.","108",NA
"We will work with trade unions, businesses and stakeholders to ensure there is a consensus on this vital issue.","405",NA
"A Labour approach to Brexit will ensure there can be no rolling back of key rights and protections","201.2",NA
"and that the UK does not lag behind Europe in workplace protections","701",NA
"and environmental standards in future.","501",NA
"The EU has had a huge impact in securing workplace protections and environmental safeguards.","108",NA
"But we all know that for many Brexiteers in the Tory Party, this was why they wanted to Leave – to tear up regulations","403",NA
"and weaken hard-fought rights and protections.","201.2",NA
"A Labour government will never consider these rights a burden","201.2",NA
"or accept the weakening of workers’ rights,","701",NA
"consumer rights","403",NA
"or environmental protections.","501",NA
"We will introduce legislation to ensure there are no gaps in national security and criminal justice arrangements as a result of Brexit.","605.1",NA
"Labour recognises the vital role that cross-border agencies such as Eurojust and Europol have played in making Britain safer and that European Arrest Warrants have been invaluable.","108",NA
"A Labour government will seek to retain membership of these agencies and continue European Arrest Warrant arrangements.","108",NA
"Labour will seek a Brexit deal that delivers for all regions and nations of the UK.","301",NA
"We will introduce a ‘presumption of devolution’ where devolved powers transferred from the EU will go straight to the relevant region or nation.","301",NA
"For many people and for much of our country, power can feel just as remote and unaccountable in Westminster as it does in Brussels.","301",NA
"So a Labour government will seek to put powers as close to communities as possible.","301",NA
"We will ensure there is no drop in EU Structural Funding as a result of Brexit until the end of the current EU funding round in 2019/20.","108",NA
"As part of Labour’s plans to rebalance and rebuild the economy, we will ensure that no region or nation of the UK is affected by the withdrawal of EU funding for the remainder of this Parliament.","408",NA
"This will also apply to the funding of peace and reconciliation projects in Northern Ireland.","301",NA
"We will also improve engagement and dialogue with the devolved administrations and seek to ensure the final Brexit deal addresses specific concerns.","301",NA
"In particular Labour will ensure there is no return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland","101",NA

"When we invest in people to develop their skills and capabilities, we all benefit from a stronger economy and society.","506",NA
"At a time when working lives and the skills our economy needs are changing rapidly, governments have the responsibility to make lifelong learning a reality by giving everyone the opportunity to access education throughout their lives.","506",NA
"To meet this responsibility, Labour will create a unified National Education Service (NES) for England to move towards cradle-to-grave learning that is free at the point of use.","506",NA
"The NES will be built on the principle that ‘Every Child – and Adult – Matters’ and will incorporate all forms of education, from early years through to adult education.","506",NA
"When the 1945 Labour government established the NHS, it created one of the central institutions of fairness of the 20th century.","503",NA
"The NES will do the same for the 21 st, giving people confidence and hope by making education a right, not a privilege,","503",NA
"and building bridges where the Conservatives build barriers.","503",NA
"EARLY YEARS","H",NA
"Currently, there is a gap between the end of maternity leave and the beginning of full-time schooling.","504",NA
"This gap can make it difficult for parents, particularly women, to return to work, unless they have access to informal childcare support.","504",NA
"There is also extensive evidence that early years education has a major impact on child development, and that time in a formal education setting for young children can improve performance at GCSE and beyond.","506",NA
"Labour would seek to roll out educational provision for early years children as part of a National Education Service that is truly cradle-to-grave.","506",NA
"Labour introduced free childcare hours for parents, which were fully funded and resourced.","504",NA
"Under the Conservatives, the free hours entitlement is chronically under-funded, with provision patchy and hard to navigate.","504",NA
"Many providers now simply refuse to participate in the scheme.","504",NA
"The result is that many parents aren’t even getting the hours they’re entitled to.","504",NA
"Labour would: · Overhaul the existing childcare system in which subsidies are given directly to parents who often struggle to use them, and transition to a system of high-quality childcare places in mixed environments with direct government subsidy.","504",NA
"Maintain current commitments on free hours and make significant capital investment during our first two years of government, to ensure that the places exist to meet demand.","504",NA
"Phase in subsidised provision on top of free-hour entitlements, to ensure that everyone has access to affordable childcare, no matter their working pattern.","504",NA
"Transition to a qualified, graduate-led workforce, by increasing staff wages and enhancing training opportunities.","504",NA
"This will benefit staff, who are among our worst-paid workers,","701",NA
"and improve child development.","506",NA
"Extend the 30 free hours to all twoyear-olds, and move towards making some childcare available for oneyear-olds","504",NA
"and extending maternity pay to 12 months.","504",NA
"Sure Start, and the support it gives to vulnerable and hard-to-reach parents, was one of the great achievements of the previous Labour government, but under the Conservatives 1,200 Sure Start centres have been lost.","504",NA
"Labour will halt the closures and increase the amount of money available for Sure Start.","504",NA
"SCHOOLS","H",NA
"Conservative cuts are starving schools of the funding they need to deliver a first class education.","506",NA
"Crippling underfunding is driving up class sizes and forcing schools to cut corners.","506",NA
"A narrow curriculum and a culture of assessment is driving away teachers, creating a recruitment and retention crisis.","506",NA
"Labour will not waste money on inefficient free schools and the Conservatives’ grammar schools vanity project.","506",NA
"Labour does not want a return to secondary moderns.","506",NA
"We will also oppose any attempt to force schools to become academies.","506",NA
"Labour’s schools policy will be built on the following four foundations: ·Investment – we will make sure schools are properly resourced by reversing the Conservatives’ cuts and ensuring that all schools have the resources they need.","506",NA
"We will introduce a fairer funding formula that leaves no school worse off, while redressing the historical underfunding of certain schools.","506",NA
"Labour will also invest in new school buildings, including the phased removal of asbestos from existing schools.","506",NA
"Quality – we will drive up standards across the board, learning from examples of best practice, such as Labour’s London Challenge, to encourage co-operation and strong leadership across schools.","506",NA
"We and trust in teachers and support staff professionalism to refocus their workload on what happens in the classroom.","506",NA
"Accountability – Labour will ensure that all schools are democratically accountable,","202.1",NA
"including appropriate controls to see that they serve the public interest and their local communities.","606.1",NA
"We will require joined-up admissions policies across local schools to enable councils to fulfil their responsibilities on child places,","506",NA
"to simplify the admissions process for parents","506",NA
"and to ensure that no child slips through the net.","506",NA
"Inclusion – Every child is unique, and a Labour-led education system will enable each to find their learning path through a wide choice of courses and qualifications.","506",NA
"We will invest in measures to close the attainment gap between children from different backgrounds.","503",NA
"To give all children the best start in life, we will reduce class sizes to less than 30 for all five-, six-, and seven-year-olds, and seek to extend that as resources allow.","506",NA
"To aid attainment, we will introduce free school meals for all primary school children, paid for by removing the VAT exemption on private school fees.","504",NA
"We will abandon plans to reintroduce baseline assessments and launch a commission to look into curriculum and assessment, starting by reviewing Key Stage 1 and 2 SATs.","506",NA
"The world’s most successful education systems use more continuous assessment, which avoids ‘teaching for the test’.","506",NA
"We will tackle the teacher recruitment and retention crisis by ending the public-sector pay cap,","506",NA
"giving teachers more direct involvement in the curriculum,","506",NA
"and tackling rising workloads by reducing monitoring and bureaucracy.","506",NA
"We will also consult on introducing teacher sabbaticals and placements with industry to encourage interaction between education and industry and introduce broad experiences into the classroom.","506",NA
"We will reintroduce the Schools Support Staff Negotiating Body and national pay settlements for teachers.","506",NA
"We will put £150 million back into supporting our children in schools by scrapping the Conservatives’ nonsensical plans for schools to pay the apprenticeship levy.","506",NA
"We will extend schools-based counselling to all schools to improve children’s mental health, at a cost of £90 million per year.","504",NA
"And we will deliver a strategy for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) based on inclusivity,","506",NA
"and embed SEND more substantially into training for teachers and non-teaching staff, so that staff, children and their parents are properly supported.","506",NA
"SKILLS","H",NA
"At a time when technology is changing demand for different kinds of skills, and evolving patterns of work mean that people are more likely to pursue several careers during their working lives, it is crucial that our education system enables people to upskill and retrain over their lifetimes.","411",NA
"As part of our dynamic industrial strategy, lifelong training will deliver productivity and growth to the whole economy while transforming the lives of individuals and communities.","411",NA
"To ensure that we deliver for every part of the UK, we will devolve responsibility for skills, wherever there is an appetite, to city regions or devolved administrations.","301",NA
"Further and Adult Education","H",NA
"Despite claiming to be committed to delivering high-quality training, the Conservatives have ruthlessly cut funding for FE colleges – our main provider of adult and vocational education – and reduced entitlements for adult learners.","411",NA
"This has led to diminishing numbers of courses and students, and plunged the sector into crisis.","411",NA
"Labour would introduce free, lifelong education in Further Education (FE) colleges, enabling everyone to upskill or retrain at any point in life.","411",NA
"Our skills and training sector has been held back by repeated reorganisation, which deprives providers, learners and employers of the consistency they need to assess quality.","411",NA
"Labour would abandon Conservative plans to once again reinvent the wheel by building new technical colleges, redirecting the money to increase teacher numbers in the FE sector.","411",NA
"We share the broad aims of the Sainsbury Review but would ensure vocational routes incorporate the service sector as well as traditional manufacturing, working in tandem with our broad industrial strategy to deliver for the whole economy.","411",NA
"We will improve careers advice and open up a range of routes through, and back into, education, striking a balance between classroom and on-the job training, to ensure students gain both technical and soft skills.","411",NA
"To implement the Sainsbury recommendations, we would correct historic neglect of the FE sector by giving the sector the investment – in teachers and facilities – it deserves to become a world-leading provider of adult and vocational education.","411",NA
"More specifically, we would: ·Bring funding for 16 to18-year-olds in line with Key Stage 4 baselines, while ensuring that the budget is distributed fairly between colleges and school sixth forms","411",NA
"Restore the Education Maintenance Allowance for 16 to 18-year-olds from lower and middle income backgrounds","411",NA
"Replace Advanced Learner Loans and upfront course fees with direct funding, making FE courses free at the point of use, including English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) courses.","411",NA
"Drive up quality and consistency in the FE sector by:","411",NA
"Encouraging co-operation and leadership across colleges and sixth forms, improving curriculum breadth and quality","411",NA
"Setting a target, backed up by funding, for all FE teaching staff to have a teaching qualification within five years.","411",NA
"In recognition of the role played by private-sector providers, we would extend support for training to teachers in the private sector","411",NA
"Increase capital investment to equip colleges to deliver T-levels and an official pre-apprenticeship trainee programme.","411",NA
"Apprenticeships","H",NA
"Employer-led training is the most effective way of meeting our growing skills gap.","411",NA
"Labour supports the apprenticeship levy, but will take steps to ensure that every apprenticeship is of a high quality.","411",NA
"Labour will: · Maintain the apprenticeship levy while taking measures to ensure high quality by requiring the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education to report on an annual basis to the Secretary of State on quality outcomes of completed apprenticeships to ensure they deliver skilled workers for employers and real jobs for apprentices at the end of their training.","411",NA
"And we will work with the devolved administrations to improve the operation of the levy","301",NA
"Set a target to double the number of completed apprenticeships at NVQ level 3 by 2022","411",NA
"Give employers more flexibility in how the levy is deployed, including allowing the levy to be used for pre-apprenticeship programmes","411",NA

"Protect the £440 million funding for apprenticeships for small-and medium-sized employers who don’t pay the levy","402",NA
"Set targets to increase apprenticeships for people with disabilities, care leavers and veterans,","705",NA
"and ensure broad representation of women, BAME, LGBT and people with disabilities in all kinds of apprenticeships","503",NA
"Consult on introducing incentives for large employers to over-train numbers of apprentices to fill skills gaps in the supply chain and the wider sector","411",NA
"Reverse cuts to Unionlearn","701",NA
"Set up a commission on Lifelong Learning tasked with integrating further and higher education.","411",NA
"HIGHER EDUCATION","H",NA
"Labour believes education should be free, and we will restore this principle.","506",NA
"No one should be put off educating themselves for lack of money or through fear of debt.","503",NA
"There is a real fear that students are being priced out of university education.","503",NA
"Last year saw the steepest fall in university applications for 30 years.","506",NA
"Since the Conservatives came to power, university tuition fees have been trebled to over £9,000 a year,","506",NA
"and maintenance grants have been abolished and replaced with loans.","504",NA
"The average student now graduates from university, and starts their working life, with debts of £44,000.","706",NA
"Labour will reintroduce maintenance grants for university students,","504",NA
"and we will abolish university tuition fees.","506",NA
"University tuition is free in many northern European countries, and under a Labour government it will be free here too.","506",NA
"A FAIR DEAL AT WORK","H",NA
"Work should provide people with security and fulfilment.","701",NA
"But for too many people work is insecure and does not make ends meet.","701",NA
"The Conservatives boast about the recovery of employment, but our labour market is failing.","701",NA
"Real-terms pay is still lower than before the crash,","701",NA
"and jobs are increasingly low skilled and insecure.","701",NA
"A Labour government will invest in enforcement through a new Ministry of Labour,","701",NA
"and empower workers and their trade unions – because we are stronger when we stand together.","701",NA
"So we will review the rules on union recognition so that more workers have the security of a union.","701",NA
"At the same time as strengthening workers’ rights, we will make work more fulfilling by using public investment to upgrade our economy and create high-quality jobs.","701",NA
"While the Conservatives stand back and allow insecure work to spread, Labour will act to guarantee good jobs and businesses.","701",NA
"RIGHTS AT WORK","H",NA
"The next Labour government will bring in a 20-point plan for security and equality at work:","701",NA
"Give all workers equal rights from day one, whether part-time or full-time, temporary or permanent – so that working conditions are not driven down.","701",NA
"Ban zero hours contracts – so that every worker gets a guaranteed number of hours each week.","701",NA
"Legislate to ensure that any employer wishing to recruit labour from abroad does not undercut workers at home – because it causes divisions when one workforce is used against another.","701",NA
"Repeal the Trade Union Act and roll out sectoral collective bargaining – because the most effective way to maintain good rights at work is collectively through a union.","701",NA
"Guarantee trade unions a right to access workplaces – so that unions can speak to members and potential members.","701",NA
"Propose four new public holidays – bringing our country together to mark our four national patron saints’ days.","701",NA
"These will be additional to statutory holiday entitlement so that workers in Britain get the same proper breaks as in other countries.","701",NA
"Raise the Minimum Wage to the level of the Living Wage (expected to be at least £10 per hour by 2020) – for all workers aged 18 or over, so that work pays.","412",NA
"End the Public Sector Pay Cap – because public sector workers deserve a pay rise after years of falling wages.","504",NA
"Amend the takeover code to ensure every takeover proposal has a clear plan in place to protect workers and pensioners – because workers shouldn’t suffer when a company is sold.","403",NA
"Roll out maximum pay ratios of 20:1 in the public sector and in companies bidding for public contracts – because it cannot be right that wages at the top keep rising while everyone else’s stagnates.","503",NA
"Ban unpaid internships – because it’s not fair for some to get a leg up when others can’t afford to.","503",NA
"Enforce all workers’ rights to trade union representation at work – so that all workers can be supported when negotiating with their employer.","701",NA
"Abolish employment tribunal fees – so that people have access to justice.","701",NA
"Double paid paternity leave to four weeks and increase paternity pay – because fathers are parents too and deserve to spend more time with their new babies.","504",NA
"Strengthen protections for women against unfair redundancy – because no one should be penalised for having children.","503",NA
"Hold a public inquiry into blacklisting – to ensure that blacklisting truly becomes and remains a thing of the past.","701",NA
"Give equalities reps statutory rights – so they have time to protect workers from discrimination.","503",NA
"Reinstate protection against third party harassment – because everyone deserves to be safe at work.","701",NA
"Use public spending power to drive up standards, including only awarding public contracts to companies which recognise trade unions.","701",NA
"Introduce a civil enforcement system to ensure compliance with gender pay auditing – so that all workers have fair access to employment and promotion opportunities and are treated fairly at work.","503",NA
"A Labour government will ensure Britain abides by the global Labour standards of the ILO conventions.","701",NA
"All workers should be able to work in a safe environment and return to their families at the end of the day.","701",NA
"Labour will enforce regulations that save lives.","701",NA
"As well as legislating against zero hours contracts, there are many more workers on short hours contracts (some only guaranteed a few hours per week), but who regularly work far more.","701",NA
"We will strengthen the law so that those who work regular hours for more than 12 weeks will have a right to a regular contract, reflecting those hours.","701",NA
"We will also scrap the changes brought in by the Conservatives in 2014 to TUPE, which weakened the protections for workers transferring between contractors,","701",NA
"and we will abolish the loophole to the agency workers regulations known as the Swedish derogation.","701",NA
"We will consult with employers and trade unions on legislating for statutory bereavement leave, for time off work after the loss of close family members.","701",NA
"We will also consult on toughening the law against assaulting workers who have to enforce laws such as age-related sales or ticketing arrangements, and who face regular abuse.","605.1",NA
"Labour will maintain the ACAS Early Conciliation System to try to solve workplace issues efficiently,","701",NA
"and we will protect the current compromise on Sunday trading hours.","701",NA
"Labour will also legislate to permit secure online and workplace balloting for industrial action votes and^internal union elections.","701",NA
"Workers in Britain are among the easiest and cheapest to make redundant, meaning when multinational companies are taking decisions to downsize that British workers are at a disadvantage.","701",NA
"We will consult with trade unions and industry on reviewing redundancy arrangements to bring workers in Britain more into line with their European counterparts.","701",NA
"Stagnating incomes have forced many to take on more debt.","701",NA
"Labour will introduce a version of Scotland’s Debt Arrangement Scheme to give breathing space to households struggling with high debts.","701",NA
"SELF-EMPLOYED WORKERS","H",NA
"Self-employment can bring many benefits, freedoms and flexibilities to people – and is a vital and often entrepreneurial sector of our economy.","402",NA
"But there is also mounting evidence that workers are being forced into self-employment by unscrupulous employers to avoid costs and their duties to workers.","701",NA
"Labour will clamp down on bogus self-employment by: · Shifting the burden of proof, so that the law assumes a worker is an employee unless the employer can prove otherwise.","701",NA
"Imposing punitive fines on employers not meeting their responsibilities, helping to deter others from doing the same.","701",NA
"Involving trade unions in enforcement, e.g. by giving them a seat on the executive board of the new Ministry of Labour.","701",NA
"Giving the Ministry of Labour the resources to enforce all workers’ rights.","701",NA
"Banning payroll companies, sometimes known as umbrella companies, which create a false structure to limit employers’ tax liabilities and limit workers’ rights.","701",NA
"Giving employment agencies and end-users joint responsibility for ensuring that the rights of agency workers are enforced.","701",NA
"Rolling out sectoral collective bargaining and strengthening trade union rights, because empowering people to claim their own rights in the workplace is the most effective means of enforcement.","701",NA
"We would also extend the rights of employees to all workers, including shared parental pay, making a substantial and immediate difference to the quality of life of people in insecure work.","701",NA
"But there are real concerns that rapid changes to the world of work are rendering existing employment categories outdated.","701",NA
"Labour recognises that the law often struggles to keep up with the ever-changing new forms of employment and work, so we will set up a dedicated commission to modernise the law around employment status.","701",NA
"New statutory definitions of employment status would reduce the need for litigation and improve compliance.","701",NA
"The commission will be led by legal and academic experts with representation from industry and trade unions.","701",NA
"SOCIAL SECURITY","H",NA
"After seven years of rising poverty and inequality, Labour will rebuild and transform our social security system.","504",NA
"Like the NHS, our social security system is there for all of us in our time of need, providing security and dignity in retirement and the basics in life should we become sick or disabled, or fall on hard times.","504",NA
"DIGNITY FOR PENSIONERS","H",NA
"Labour will always be on the side of pensioners and help ensure security and dignity for older people in retirement.","504",NA
"As the Conservatives abandon their commitments to older people, Labour will guarantee the state pension ‘triple lock’ throughout the next Parliament.","504",NA
"It will rise by at least 2.5 per cent a year or be increased to keep pace with inflation or earnings, whichever is higher.","504",NA
"The Winter Fuel Allowance and free bus passes will also be guaranteed as universal benefits.","504",NA
"We will protect the pensions of UK citizens living overseas in the EU or further afield.","504",NA
"Over 2.5 million women born in the 1950s have had their state pension age changed without fair notification.","504",NA
"These women deserve both recognition for the injustice they have suffered and some kind of compensation for their losses.","504",NA
"Alongside our commitment to extend Pension Credit to hundreds of thousands of the most vulnerable women, Labour is exploring options for further transitional protections, to ensure that all these women have security and dignity in older age.","504",NA
"This must never happen again.","504",NA
"Labour will legislate so that accrued rights to the basic state pension cannot be changed, but future benefits can.","504",NA
"The pension age is due to rise to 66 by the end of 2020.","504",NA
"Labour rejects the Conservatives’ proposal to increase the state pension age even further.","504",NA
"We will commission a new review of the pension age, specifically tasked with developing a flexible retirement policy to reflect both the contributions made by people, the wide variations in life expectancy, and the arduous conditions of some work.","504",NA

"LEADING RICHER LIVES","H",NA
"LOCAL COMMUNITIES","H",NA
"Councils deliver vital local services to our communities, but their budgets have been slashed by Conservative cuts.","301",NA

"Labour believes in devolving power to local communities but that requires the necessary funding follows.","301",NA

"But under the Conservatives, planning has been under-resourced and disempowered, with democratic planning authorities unable to stand up to big developers.","301",NA

"We will promote the care and educational achievement of our most vulnerable children and increase support for children in kinship and foster care, and their families.","504",NA

"safety is compromised,","403",NA
"fares have risen,","412",NA

"and air quality has worsened.","501",NA
"On our railways, we pay some of the highest fares in Europe for increasingly unreliable and overcrowded services.","413",NA
"The beneficiaries of public funding siphoned off through transport privatisations have been the earnings of directors, dividends for shareholders and the coffers of overseas governments.","503",NA

"Unlike the Conservatives, Labour believes Britain’s foreign policy should be guided by the values of peace,","106",NA
"universal rights","201.2",NA

"Today, these values are being tested.","107",NA
"As we leave the European Union, keeping Britain global is one of our country’s most urgent tasks.","107",NA
"We face the most complex, interwoven security and development challenges of our time;","104",NA
"ongoing wars across the Middle East,","104",NA
"unprecedented numbers of refugees,","201.2",NA
"global terrorism,","104",NA
"climate change,","501",NA
"the threat of nuclear conflict,","104",NA
"a devastating food crisis across East Africa and beyond,","107",NA
"an erratic US administration","102",NA
"and a more combative government in Russia.","104",NA
"The lessons of the past, including those from the Chilcot Inquiry, show why our response to these challenges must be different.","105",NA
"We cannot seek to solve the world’s problems on our own, but instead must exhaust diplomatic solutions alongside international, regional and local partners within the framework of international law.","107",NA

"Since the Second World War, Britain’s most important diplomatic relationship has been with the US.","101",NA

"Labour is committed to a comprehensive peace in the Middle East based on a two-state solution – a secure Israel alongside a secure and viable state of Palestine.","106",NA

"From Afghanistan and Iraq to the streets of European cities, Daesh continues to commit acts of indiscriminate barbarism.","104",NA

"and we will advocate a long-term multinational political strategy, led by regional actors, to tackle the spread of extremism.","104",NA
"In our discussions with different governments, including China, Egypt, the Gulf States, Myanmar, the Philippines, Russia and Turkey, we will urge respect for human rights","201.2",NA
"and the rule of law.","202.1",NA
"We will review all training and equipment contracts with repressive regimes, to ensure that Britain never colludes in the mistreatment of civilians.","201.2",NA
"We will always stand up for the rights, interests and self-determination of Britain’s overseas territories and their citizens, whether protecting the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands against anyone who would seek to challenge it, or supporting the right of the Chagos isla nders to return to their homelands.","101",NA
"We will reclaim Britain’s leading role in tackling climate change, working hard to preserve the Paris Agreement and deliver on international commitments to reduce emissions while mitigating the impacts of climate change on developing countries.","501",NA

"We will work with our international partners to build support for UN reform and make its institutions more effective and responsive.","107",NA
"We will appoint dedicated global ambassadors for women’s rights, LGBT rights and religious freedom to fight discrimination and promote equality globally.","503",NA
"Exports, trade and investment play a vital role in creating jobs and growth in Britain,","410",NA
"and Labour supports the considerable contribution that a responsible, world-leading defence and security industry makes to the UK economy.","410",NA
"However, we also believe that strong export controls have a vital role to play in sustaining a legitimate trade in arms, while protecting UKjobs and R&D.","201.2",NA
"Labour will therefore implement the Arms Trade Treaty to a consistently high standard, including ceasing arms exports to countries where there is concern that they will be used to violate international humanitarian law (IHL).","201.2",NA
"In particular, Labour will demand a comprehensive, independent, UN-led investigation into alleged violations of IHL in Yemen, including air strikes on civilians by the Saudi-led coalition.","201.2",NA

"We will ensure that our armed forces are properly equipped and resourced to respond to wide-ranging security challenges.","104",NA
"Labour will commit to effective UN peacekeeping, including support for a UN Emergency Peace Service.","107",NA

"Alongside our commitment to NATO, we will continue to work with the EU on a range of operational missions to promote and support global and regional security.","104",NA
"The last Labour government consistently spent above the NATO benchmark of 2 per cent of GDP.","104",NA
"Conservative spending cuts have put Britain’s security at risk, shrinking the army to its smallest size since the Napoleonic wars.","104",NA
"The scrapping of Nimrod, HMS Ark Royal and the Harrier jump jets have weakened our defences and cost British taxpayers millions.","104",NA
"Labour’s commitment to spending at least 2 per cent of GDP on defence will guarantee that our Armed Forces have the necessary capabilities to fulfil the full range of obligations,","104",NA
"and ensure our conventional forces are versatile and able to deploy in a range of roles.","104",NA

"We have a duty to properly reward and remunerate our Armed Forces.","104",NA
"Under the Conservatives, our Armed Forces have been hit by rent rises, pay restraint, and changes to tax and benefits, putting real pressure on service personnel and their families.","104",NA
"We will ensure they get the pay and living conditions that their service merits.","104",NA
"Dedicated service personnel are at the heart of our defence policy.","104",NA
"Labour will immediately examine recruitment and retention policies in order to stem the exodus seen under the Conservatives.","104",NA

"DEVELOPMENT","H",NA
"Labour has a proud record on international development.","107",NA

"and develop a targeted development agenda based on the principles of redistribution,","503",NA
"social justice,","503",NA
"women’s rights","503",NA
"and poverty reduction.","107",NA
"Labour will take robust action to end the self-regulation of Department for International Development private contractors, establishing and enforcing new rules to ensure aid is used to reduce poverty for the many, not to increase profits for the few.","503",NA
"We fully support the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agreed globally to eradicate poverty","107",NA
"and protect the environment.","501",NA
"Labour will develop a cross-government strategy for ensuring the SDGs are implemented, and report annually to Parliament on our performance.","202.1",NA
"In the wake of Brexit, to fulfil our national obligations under the SDGs, Labour will guarantee the least developed countries continued access to the UK market to protect vital export revenues.","107",NA
"There are more refugees and displaced people around the world than at any time since the Second World War.","201.2",NA
"This is a failure of diplomacy,","106",NA
"conflict resolution","106",NA
"and of human rights, which is why they will be at the heart of Labour’s foreign policy.","201.2",NA
"The Conservatives have completely failed to show any leadership on this issue.","305.1",NA
