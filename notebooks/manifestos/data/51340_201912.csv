"THE BATTLE AGAINST BREXIT","H",NA
"After this election, Boris Johnson will use every tool at his disposal to remove Northern Ireland from the European Union to satisfy the ERG and Nigel Farage.","108",NA
"People here know that the European Union has played a central role in our peace process,","108",NA
"providing constitutional comfort","108",NA
"and critical resource to stabilise our new society.","108",NA
"A Conservative government, propped up by the DUP, will not hesitate in dismantling that architecture to achieve their selfish ambition of a reckless Brexit.","108",NA
"Regardless of your feelings about Westminster and its behaviour over the last three years – that is where the battleground against Brexit now is.","108",NA
"The solidarity we have received from our European friends and neighbours has been immense and it is appreciated.","108",NA
"Only MPs who take their seats can stop Brexit and stop Boris Johnson.","108",NA
"Small numbers will make a big difference to the parliamentary arithmetic, particularly when it comes to neutralising the influence of the DUP.","108",NA
"SDLP MPs will use their votes to protect people, businesses and communities here at all costs.","108",NA
"We will go to work to stop Boris and stop Brexit.","108",NA
"A POLITICAL VACUUM","H",NA
"In the absence of an inclusive, power sharing Executive at Stormont, more and more decisions have been outsourced to MPs in London.","301",NA
"While two parties abdicate their responsibility to compromise, come together and govern, Westminster has slowly started to take decisions on issues that we should be taking here.","301",NA
"That includes: Welfare","504",NA
"Equal Marriage","604",NA
"Climate emergency","501",NA
"Historical  Institutional  Abuse compensation","503",NA
"Victims’ Pensions","503",NA
"NHS Privatisation","504",NA
"The SDLP believes that decisions should be made in Belfast not in London.","301",NA
"We want power back on Irish soil not in Westminster.","301",NA
"However, it is impossible to argue that Westminster is irrelevant while it makes decisions affecting the lives of people here.","301",NA
"It is dishonest of other parties to say Westminster does not affect our lives while writing to British Government Ministers asking them to act in our interests.","301",NA
"SDLP MPs are more interested in writing laws than writing letters.","305.1",NA
"We have used our influence at Westminster in the past, across a range of issues, to secure more for people here, including:","305.1",NA
"City and Region growth deals for Northern Ireland Belfast and Derry;","410",NA

"Stop Boris, Stop Brexit","H",NA
"THE MOST PRO-EUROPE PARTY","H",NA
"The SDLP is proud of our history as the most pro-European party on this island.","108",NA
"While others opposed the principles of European integration, our leaders were inspired by the European Union as the world’s most successful peace project - bringing former enemies together to forge a new vision for the continent from the fierce antagonism of the second world war.","108",NA
"The European ideals are ingrained in our own peace process thanks to the work of SDLP Leaders and negotiators.","108",NA
"That’s why we were the only party in Northern Ireland to officially register to campaign against Brexit and the first party to propose special status.","108",NA
"It’s also why we are the only local party that consistently voted against withdrawal from the European Union at Westminster after the referendum.","108",NA
"We voted to remain.","108",NA
"For the last three years, Northern Ireland has been abandoned by abstentionist MPs and misrepresented by hardline DUP Brexiteers at Westminster who have ignored the will of people here for five minutes of influence with two Tory governments.","305.1",NA
"This election is your chance to say their time is up.","305.1",NA
"VOTING FOR CHANGE","H",NA

"Voting for continued membership of the EU Single Market and Customs Union.","108",NA
"Voting against any attempt to introduce a customs or regulatory border across Ireland.","108",NA
"Voting to prevent a damaging no-deal exit.","108",NA
"A PROGRESSIVE COALITION","H",NA
"There is no such thing as a good Brexit, there are only degrees of harm which will be inflicted on people, businesses and communities here.","108",NA
"SDLP MPs will defend the interests and the will of people here by voting to stop Brexit at every opportunity.","108",NA
"Pro-Brexit parties are already cooperating, we need a strong coalition to counter their efforts.","108",NA
"That’s why the SDLP has already taken unilateral pre-election action to maximise the pro-remain vote and remove pro-Brexit DUP MPs.","108",NA
"Our first act in a new parliament will be to bring together a progressive cross-party coalition to stop Brexit and stop Boris Johnson.","108",NA
"We will work with Labour, the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, the Greens, Plaid Cymru, the Alliance Party and anyone else who shares our goal of ending this hard Tory Brexit chaos.","108",NA

"and support schemes to allow families to make informed decisions about a clean, green future.","416.2",NA
"A SEISMIC CHALLENG E","H",NA
"Climate breakdown is the seismic global challenge facing this generation.","501",NA
"Failure to take action now will result in significant changes to our global climate and weather patterns that will devastate developed and developing economies across the world, leaving millions destitute and poverty-stricken.","501",NA
"Global warming is happening and at a much faster rate than anticipated.","501",NA
"Extraordinary action is required to keep global temperature increases below 1.5 degrees Celsius and avert irreversible damage to our climate.","501",NA
"Over the course of the last few years, millions of citizens, led by young people, across Europe and across the world have called on governments and the political establishment to take action on the climate emergency, for this generation and for the next.","501",NA
"The expressions of this crisis, through protests in European capitals and school strikes on the streets of Northern Ireland, have their roots in social, economic, ecological and political upheaval.","503",NA
"We know that this crisis will disproportionately affect those least able to bear the burden.","503",NA
"Interventions designed to tackle the climate emergency must be robust, equitable and contribute to social justice more broadly.","503",NA
"We cannot create a society that offers tax cuts to the wealthy while introducing new levies that disproportionately target the poor.","503",NA
"ECOLOGICAL & ECONOMIC EQUALITY","H",NA
"We cannot decarbonise our economy without ensuring that clean energy is affordable energy.","503",NA
"We cannot deliver income equality without a green economy that creates high quality jobs.","503",NA

"While balancing the needs of our economy with the needs of people and communities,","416.2",NA
"we must also respect the needs of our natural environment.","501",NA
"Protecting our indigenous plant and animal life is critical to preserving the delicate ecosystems which we occupy.","501",NA
"That demands a tough new look at planning policy to create a new approach to development that respects and nurtures local habitats.","416.2",NA
"The shift to a net gain approach to biodiversity and development across these islands should be examined as a potential model for an ecologically aware economy.","416.2",NA
"A GREEN TRANSITION","H",NA
"We understand the scale of the challenge facing developed economies.","416.2",NA
"We can’t step into an open, Green economy without a stable transition from where we are now.","416.2",NA
"We need to create low-carbon alternatives to high-carbon industries","416.2",NA
"and a significant support package to those working in these industries.","416.2",NA
"Our green transition will balance our duty to preserve, protect and enhance the environment","501",NA
"with the social and economic rights of all workers.","701",NA
"The European Commission estimates that measures to achieve the current 2030 climate targets alone could create an additional 900,000 jobs.","701",NA
"But first, we have to support carbon-intensive industries to make their processes more carbon neutral and resource efficient.","416.2",NA
"We also have to support workers in these sectors to develop new skills that will allow us to lead emerging and transformed industries.","701",NA
"ACTION AT EVERY LEVEL","H",NA
"The scale of the crisis we’re facing demands urgent action at every level.","416.2",NA
"That’s why SDLP councillors have established climate crisis committees in councils across Northern Ireland to examine how they can mitigate climate breakdown through procurement, by reducing reliance on single use plastics, increasing the availability of water refill stations in parks and public places among other measures.","416.2",NA
"Under an SDLP Minister, the Executive introduced the plastic bag levy, raising almost £30m for environmental projects","416.2",NA
"and removing 1.2 billion bags from circulation since 2012.","416.2",NA
"An SDLP Minister introduced a moratorium on Fracking.","416.2",NA
"An SDLP Minister refused the planning application for an incinerator at Hightown.","416.2",NA
"The limit of our ambition for renewable energy should not be heating empty sheds with biomass boilers.","416.2",NA
"Northern Ireland has immense capacity for a transformational shift from legacy fossil fuel technology to green, clean energy production.","416.2",NA
"From the potential of geothermal spots on the North Coast to diversifying our fishing fleets to support sustainable offshore wind, renewable technology is an underutilised resource.","416.2",NA
"It’s vital that we invest in renewable tech, research and development to occupy the space of leadership in this growth sector.","416.2",NA
"OUR CLIMATE PRIORITIES","H",NA
"Governments across the world must do more to secure the sustainability of our planet.","501",NA

"Acting together with our European sister nations, we can more effectively coordinate emissions reduction targets, renewable energy uptake and decarbonisation plans.","108",NA

"World Class Health Services","H",NA
"OUR VISION","H",NA
"A world class health service, delivering excellent care free at the point of need.","504",NA
"THE PRICE OF IMPASSE","H",NA
"The SDLP believes that our health service is suffering from the political impasse.","504",NA
"We need a Health Minister, scrutinised by a Health Committee, to take key decisions and unlock urgent investment.","504",NA
"It is clear that our health service has been a victim of chronic under-resourcing for a number of years, as a result of the Tory-led austerity and a lack of decisive and courageous leadership to implement strategic review after review.","504",NA
"From hospitals to community care, there has been no commitment to a strategic and properly resourced vision of how our health service will care for an expanding and ageing population.","504",NA
"Our waiting lists are growing, leading to distress for individuals and their families.","504",NA
"People in the North are at least 48 times as likely to wait more than a year for care as the closest waiting time in Britain.","504",NA
"One in four people here are on a waiting list.","504",NA
"Waiting lists in each individual Trust area here in the North are longer than the entirety of waiting lists in England.","504",NA
"It is clear our health service needs to transform to meet the needs of the people.","504",NA
"That’s why the SDLP supports the Bengoa Expert Panel report and supports removing politics from the equation and planning services based on need.","504",NA
"NHS PRIVATISATION","H",NA
"The SDLP will fight hard against any attempt to privatise our NHS.","504",NA
"Our MPs will oppose Boris Johnson and make it clear that our NHS is not on the table in any future trade negotiations with the USA.","504",NA

"The SDLP will fight for pay parity so our nurses and healthcare workers are not earning less than their counterparts in Britain.","701",NA
"We also need a comprehensive and fit-for-purpose strategy to tackle the crisis in our workforce, focusing on recruitment and retention.","701",NA
"THE IMPACT OF BREXIT ON HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE","H",NA
"Brexit will have a huge impact on public services across the North, but most acutely on our health and social care sector.","108",NA
"In Northern Ireland, 8.8% of doctors come from other EU countries.","108",NA
"In the absence of a functioning Executive, more than ever, Northern Irelands needs MPs to show up to vote in patients interests against a hard Tory Brexit that threatens health workforce supply and timely access to drugs.","108",NA
"MENTAL HEALTH","H",NA
"More than 200,000 people across the North suffer as a result of poor mental health, with almost 50% of these cases related to the conflict.","504",NA
"The SDLP believes in parity of esteem for mental health services","504",NA
"and that these services need to be properly resourced.","504",NA

"It is crucial we instill knowledge and tools in our young people, from childhood, to ensure they are resilient with strong mental wellbeing.","504",NA
"The SDLP supports enhanced dual diagnosis and services for those suffering from mental ill health and addiction,","504",NA
"particularly for under 18’s.","504",NA
"RURAL  HEALTHCARE","H",NA
"The SDLP is of the firm view that there must be a balance between centralisation of services in regional centres of excellence and ensuring that rural communities are able to access care, particularly emergency care, in a way that needs their needs.","504",NA
"We will ensure that the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service and Air Ambulance is properly resourced to meet the needs of geographically isolated communities.","504",NA
"GENERAL PRACTICE`","H",NA
"The number of GP practices in the North have decreased to the lowest level in over 20 years, providing care to on average 500 more people than 10 years previously.","504",NA
"We must properly invest in primary care provision, supporting the roll out of the multidisciplinary teams to enhance general practice.","504",NA
"The SDLP supports a review of primary care, seeking to model the service in more innovative ways with easier referral pathways.","504",NA
"MEDICAL SCHOOL AT MAGEE","H",NA
"The SDLP will support the development of a Medical School in Derry to address decades of economic inequality and long standing workforce challenges, to provide much needed primary care capacity west of the Bann.","504",NA

"Evidence highlights the impact extreme loneliness can have on the mental and physical health of an individual.","504",NA
"NORTH - SOUTH HEALTHCARE","H",NA
"The SDLP is committed to an all-island approach to health and social care.","504",NA
"We want to see increased provisions for North-South healthcare including a joined-up approach to ambulance service provision in the border areas.","504",NA
"Cross border services including ENT at Daisy Hill and Craigavon hospitals and paediatric cardiology in Dublin have all reduced waiting times and waiting lists.","504",NA
"It is vital these services are protected and more investment in cross border services is delivered.","504",NA
"FERTILITY","H",NA
"Noting that 1 in 7 families across the North experience   difficulty  in  having  children, the SDLP supports wider access to IVF treatment on the NHS","504",NA

"Investing in skills","H",NA
"OUR VISION","H",NA
"An education system that provides all of our people with the skills and opportunities to achieve their ambitions.","506",NA

"For too long, too many young people have left our schools still lacking basic numeracy and literacy training and with next-to-no training for life or the workplace.","506",NA
"Improvements mean tackling, at source, the problems which lead to educational underachievement, be they inside or outside the classroom.","506",NA
"Financial cuts to school have had a drastic effect on the ability of teachers to provide basic materials in our schools - in some areas principals have had to resort to asking parents for financial and other support to ensure schools are adequately resourced.","506",NA
"SDLP MPs will ensure that any future funding package for Northern Ireland includes ring-fenced resources for our education system.","506",NA
"EARLY YEARS","H",NA
"The first years of a child’s life are vital for their wellbeing.","504",NA
"The foundations for our paths in life are laid in these years.","504",NA
"The SDLP has consistently campaigned for an increase in free childcare provision to 20 hours per week, with a view to further increasing this to 30 hours per week.","504",NA
"We remain steadfastly committed to delivering on this commitment and any extra funding secured by SDLP MPs will be used for this purpose.","504",NA
"OUR PLEDGE","H",NA
"We will ensure that any future funding package includes ring fenced resources for university expansion and skills development.","506",NA
"PRIMARY AND POST PRIMARY SCHOOLS.","H",NA
"The political failure to restore power-sharing in Stormont, has led to a deepening of the financial crisis, with a delay in decision making leading to the decay at the heart of our education sector.","506",NA
"It is disgraceful that schools are now resorting to writing to parents asking for support so that schools can be properly resourced - this cannot continue and increased funding for schools will form a central principle of any package which SDLP MPs secure.","506",NA
"Our curriculum requires modernisation if we are to compete globally.","506",NA
"This should include the introduction of computer coding and modern languages for all children from primary school,","506",NA
"the reinstatement of the requirement to take a GCSE in a modern language","506",NA
"and the teaching of mathematics to age 18","506",NA

"AUTISM AND ADHD SUPPORT","H",NA
"The lack of support for children diagnosed with autism or ADHD is reaching crisis levels in our schools.","506",NA
"Delays in assessments, excessive bureaucracy, red-tape and the lack of co-ordination between health and educational authorities means that children and their families do not receive the help they need.","506",NA
"The SDLP will commission an urgent review of SEND education provision, including the Education Authrority’s work in this area and the implementation of the SEND Act (NI) 2016 to report urgently on improvements to be made in this area.","506",NA
"FURTHER AND HIGHER EDUCATION","H",NA
"Universities and FE Colleges are critically important to providing training and skills for our society and economy.","506",NA
"As well as providing training for our young people, they attract national and international funding and build close links with research and industry which benefits our entire economy and society.","411",NA
"The SDLP is committed to enhancing financial support for our third level institutions, ensuring that they are resourced to deliver world-class standards in teaching and research.","506",NA
"Supporting and enhancing relationships with businesses is also vital in making sure young people who want to stay here for employment are able to do so.","411",NA
"The SDLP remains committed to funding education as a public good, including putting an end to tuition fees.","506",NA
"In addition, the SDLP is committed to the expansion of the Magee campus to 10,000 student places through direct government funding, North South structural funds and further government support.","506",NA
"APPRENTICESHIPS","H",NA
"Funding for apprenticeships at all levels, including higher-level apprenticeship is vital to improve training and skills opportunities for young people and in our overall productivity.","411",NA
"The SDLP will seek to increase funding of these opportunities, and to provide direct support to universities, colleges and employers to further expand the number of Higher-Level Apprenticeships.","411",NA

"A vibrant economy","H",NA
"OUR VISION","H",NA
"A prosperous, world class economy, delivering equality and opportunity to all our citizens.","410",NA
"A BROAD CHALLENGE","H",NA
"Building a vibrant and world class economy creates jobs,","701",NA
"reduces inequality","503",NA
"and means more revenue to support public services","504",NA
"That is why the task of strengthening our economy will be the central focus of SDLP MPs, an Executive if and when it returns, and our local councils.","410",NA
"The SDLP is committed to improving our economy and growing our private sector.","410",NA
"That economy is not just our businesses, but it is all organisations, including third sector, who work to improve our society.","410",NA
"CITY DEALS","H",NA
"The SDLP pioneered the introduction of City Deals in Northern Ireland.","411",NA
"We welcome the recent developments in councils across Northern Ireland.","411",NA
"City Deals will play a key part in ensuring access to training for young people increasing employment","411",NA
"and ensuring that our technology infrastructure meets the demands of the modern economy.","411",NA
"However, it is clear that for spending to be authorised for each City Deal, we need a local Executive in place and that is absolutely vital to fully realise the potential of our City Deals.","301",NA
"OUR PLEDGE","H",NA
"The SDLP will prioritise wealth creation, training and skills,safeguarding our young people and workers against the economic threats of Brexit.","411",NA

"While our tourism market goes from strength-to-strength, key financial tools to support the tourism industry remain in the control of Westminster.","402",NA
"The SDLP will continue to call for an end to Air Passenger Duty (APD) which will allow airports in Northern Ireland to compete with their Southern counterparts and explore new routes to attract tourists.","402",NA
"In addition, the power to reduce VAT on tourism and hospitality services remains at Westminster and SDLP MPs will seek its reduction to act as an additional stimulus to our tourism market.","402",NA
"AGRICULTURE & AGRI-FOOD","H",NA
"Brexit is the greatest threat to the agriculture sector in decades and SDLP MPs will do everything in our power to stop it and to reduce the damaging effect it will have on our farming communities.","703.1",NA
"That means ensuring that everything must be done to stop a hard Brexit which would see the economic decimation of farms through the removal of tariffs","703.1",NA
"and flooding of our markets with cheap poor-quality imports.","703.1",NA
"Ensuring the maintenance of EU standards, including on animal welfare, will form a key part of our work in Westminster","703.1",NA
"and we will not support a race-to-the-bottom for any agricultural standards in any post-Brexit scenario.","703.1",NA
"SDLP MPs in Westminster will ensure that our agri-food industry has a voice at the top table when it comes to decisions on agri-food and new markets.","703.1",NA
"This means our farmers and agri-food businesses will not be disadvantaged through any UK-wide deals which may emerge.","703.1",NA
"CORPORATION  TAX","H",NA
"The SDLP supports the devolution of corporation tax powers to Northern Ireland as an absolutely vital step in growing private sector employment.","402",NA
"The impact of any cut must be competitive, especially against other similar regions, and should be focused on delivering growth in areas of high productivity and employment.","402",NA
"HOUSING","H",NA
"The work of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive and housing associations in providing social housing is absolutely vital.","504",NA
"It is important that social housing providers are given full support to ensure that more new housing is built in the areas of greatest need.","504",NA
"The reclassification of housing association debt is a vital way of ensuring the full financial strength of associations can be harnessed to build more homes.","504",NA
"Affordable housing schemes should also be expanded to give more first-time buyers the chance to own their own home.","504",NA
"This means that those who are unable to access social housing, but cannot buy their own home, are able to have this chance.","504",NA
"The SDLP will work to see the creation of more shared housing schemes, more mixed developments to include social, affordable and private homes and reform of common selection and regulation of the private rented sector.","504",NA
"PUBLIC SECTOR PAY","H",NA
"The Northern Ireland Department for Health and the Executive’s decision to reject clear recommendations from the independent pay review body about the pay regime for nurses, midwives and other health service professionals has become increasingly exploitative of these workers’ strong sense of vocation.","701",NA
"The move by the Royal College of Nurses to take industrial action for the first time in their over 100-year history is a clear indication that nurses have been taken for granted for too long and action is needed to address the immense pressure on our public servants.","701",NA
"Unlike the DUP, who voted against a pay increase for public sector workers in an amendment to a Queen’s Speech tabled by the Labour Party, SDLP MPs will use our influence and votes to deliver a consolidated pay increase for public sector workers.","701",NA
"We will always vote to deliver a fair deal for nurses, firefighters and other emergency service staff.","701",NA

"to increase the number of SMEs,","402",NA
"and to increase our levels of exports, which pale in comparison to Republic.","402",NA
"That means supporting the growth of indigenous manufacturing and attracting manufacturers from abroad to Northern Ireland.","402",NA
"It also means harnessing the spending power of local and national government to support local enterprises.","402",NA
"We will ensure that Invest NI work closely with Enterprise Ireland to learn from their success in growing the Irish economy through exports.","402",NA

"ROADS AND ROAD SAFETY","H",NA
"Northern Ireland does not have a modern roads network.","411",NA
"While continued work sees some improvements on the A5 and A6, the travel time between our two largest cities is far too long.","411",NA
"Delays in planning have added to the frustration of many of those living outside Belfast subjected to a substandard roads network.","411",NA
"The SDLP will seek fast-tracked funding for the update of our roads network, including cross-border projects like Narrow Water Bridge.","411",NA

"The SDLP is committed to the retention of our current rail network and its expansion to other locations across the North.","411",NA
"We are committed to the creation of stations at Belfast International Airport, Belfast City Airport and City of Derry Airport – these airports are all very close to existing railway lines, yet incredibly none have a dedicated railway station.","411",NA

"it would reduce car journeys by tens of thousands, thereby reducing air pollution.","416.2",NA

"Brexit has brought into sharp focus the rapid improvement required on this line, which has seen no improvement in the journey time of two hours in over 20 years","411",NA
"At an era when journeys of a similar distance on European networks take one hour, we should be aiming to deliver that speed of service here.","411",NA
"The SDLP welcomes the various feasibility studies underway at present to explore how this vital railway line can be improved.","411",NA
"RURAL  BROADBAND","H",NA
"Our rural towns, villages and countryside have been left behind in the broadband revolution.","411",NA

"REGIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE COMMISSION","H",NA

"It also produces expert-led research into the most pressing infrastructure challenges while monitoring progress on delivering new projects.","411",NA

"They must not be used as a bargaining chip in any Brexit negotiations.","607.1",NA
"Immigration has enriched the North.","607.1",NA

"Tackling poverty and empowering citizens will be a key priority for the SDLP in Westminster","503",NA

"It is a political choice.","504",NA
"This UN report confirmed, as does the mountain of evidence, that women, children, the disabled and low income working families, are among the hardest hit groups by Welfare Reform.","504",NA
"In Northern Ireland given our unique circumstances; the legacy of the conflict, the shortage and segregated nature of our social housing, higher disability rates and larger family sizes, means the impact of Welfare Reform is particularly hard hitting.","504",NA
