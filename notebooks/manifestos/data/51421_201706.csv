"1.1 Giving the people the final say","H",NA
"Liberal Democrats are open and outward-looking.","107",NA
"We passionately believe that Britain’s relationship with its neighbours is stronger as part of the European Union.","108",NA
"Whatever its imperfections, the EU remains the best framework for working effectively and co-operating in the pursuit of our shared aims.","108",NA
"It has led directly to greater prosperity,","410",NA
"increased trade,","407",NA
"investment and jobs,","701",NA
"better security","104",NA
"and a greener environment.","501",NA
"Britain is better off in the EU.","108",NA
"Liberal Democrats campaigned for the UK to remain in the EU.","108",NA
"However, we acknowledge the result of the 2016 referendum, which gave the government a mandate to start negotiations to leave.","202.4",NA
"The decision Britain took, though, was simply whether to remain in or to leave the European Union.","202.1",NA
"There was no option on the ballot paper to choose the shape of our future relationship with the EU on vital issues including trade, travel or security.","108",NA
"While much remains uncertain about Theresa May’s approach, it is now clear that the Conservatives are campaigning for a hard Brexit.","108",NA
"This means leaving the single market, ending freedom of movement and abandoning the customs union – even though these choices will make the UK poorer and disappoint many leave voters who wanted a different outcome.","108",NA
"The effects of Brexit are already being felt.","108",NA
"The value of the pound has plummeted.","408",NA
"Inflation has risen.","408",NA
"Growth in the economy has slowed","410",NA
"and the government is already borrowing billions more to fill the gap in lost tax revenue.","414",NA
"Young people, who voted overwhelmingly to remain, are being told their voices do not matter.","202.1",NA
"Urgent problems, such as the future of the NHS, are being neglected because of the sheer scale of the challenge posed by Brexit.","108",NA
"A hard Brexit will make all these problems worse.","108",NA
"It is the wrong choice for the country.","108",NA
"Liberal Democrats will fight to prevent a hard Brexit.","108",NA
"At the end of negotiations there will be a decision on the deal.","202.1",NA
"The Conservatives want the decision to be taken by politicians.","202.1",NA
"Liberal Democrats believe the British people should have the final say.","202.1",NA
"That’s why, when the terms of our future relationship with the EU have been negotiated (over the next two years on the Government’s timetable), we will put that deal to a vote of the British people in a referendum,","202.4",NA
"with the alternative option of staying in the EU on the ballot paper.","108",NA
"We continue to believe that there is no deal as good for the UK outside the EU as the one it already has^as a member.","108",NA
"Every vote for the Liberal Democrats in this election is a vote to give the final say to the British people.","202.1",NA
"1.2 Fighting a hard Brexit","H",NA
"During negotiations, we commit ourselves to use our strength in parliament to press for keeping Britain as close as possible to Europe.","108",NA
"Our priorities will include: Protection of rights for EU citizens and UK citizens:","108",NA
"We will press for the UK to unilaterally guarantee the rights of EU nationals in the UK, ending their ongoing uncertainty.","108",NA
"We will call for the overhaul and simplification of the registration process and the requirements for EU nationals to obtain permanent residence and UK citizenship, as the current system is not fit for purpose.","303",NA
"We will urge the government, and use our influence with Liberal leaders in European countries, to secure the same rights for UK citizens living in European Union countries.","108",NA
"Membership of the single market and customs union: We believe that any deal negotiated for the UK outside the EU must ensure that trade can continue without customs controls at the border,","108",NA
"and must maintain membership of the single market, which smooths trade between the UK and the continent by providing a common ‘rule book’ for businesses and a common mechanism to ensure that everyone abides by the rules.","108",NA
"Freedom of movement: We support the principle of freedom of movement – to abandon it would threaten Britain’s prosperity","410",NA
"and reputation as an open, tolerant society.","607.1",NA
"Any deal negotiated for the U K outside the EU must protect the right to work, travel, study and retire across the EU.","108",NA
"Any restrictions sought by the government must take account of the vital importance of EU workers to the British economy, including public services.","607.1",NA
"Opportunities for young people:In an increasingly globalised and complex world, it is vital that our young people are afforded the same opportunities their parents enjoyed to work, study and travel abroad.","706",NA
"To that end we will do everything we can to protect Erasmus+ and other EU-funded schemes which increase opportunities for young people.","706",NA
"Defending social rights and equalities:","503",NA
"Many important protections such as the right to 52 weeks’ maternity leave and rights to annual leave are currently based on EU law,","701",NA
"and many of these rights have been upheld at the European Court of Justice.","108",NA
"Liberal Democrats will fight to ensure that these entitlements are not undermined.","701",NA
"Maintaining environmental standards:","501",NA
"The European Union has created the highest environmental standards in the world.","501",NA
"We have a duty to future generations to protect our environment and tackle climate change.","501",NA
"Liberal Democrats will ensure that everything is done to maintain those high standards in UK law, including the closest possible co-operation on climate and energy policy.","501",NA
"Law enforcement and judicial co-operation:  Europol, the European Arrest Warrant and shared access to police databases have helped make Britain’s streets safer.","605.1",NA
"We will fight to maintain maximum co-operation to ensure criminals are pursued quickly and effectively, and police are not frustrated by huge amounts of red tape.","605.1",NA
"British business and jobs: We must protect support for domestic industries such as farming, tourism and the creative industries,","406",NA
"as well as regional support for deprived areas.","503",NA
"The City of London is Europe’s financial capital","601.1",NA
"and must retain its full rights in EU financial markets.","108",NA
"Science and research funding: Research is vital for our long-term prosperity, security and wellbeing –","411",NA
"but the Leave vote has already started to affect existing and proposed research programmes.","411",NA
"We will campaign against any reduction in investment in UK universities","506",NA
"and for their right to apply for EU funds on equal terms.","506",NA
"Travel and tourism: Britain is an outward-looking country with commercial and leisure interests around the world, particularly in Europe.","502",NA
"We will strive to retain traveller and tourist benefits such as the European Health Insurance Card, reduced roaming charges and pet passports, all of which are at risk by leaving the European Union.","108",NA
"Respect for the interests of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland: We will fight to ensure that the priorities and long-term interests of the nations of the UK are fully taken into account during negotiations.","301",NA
"We will oppose any moves that threaten the political stability of Northern Ireland.","305.3",NA
"We will also campaign to protect the rights of the people of Gibraltar.","101",NA
"2 Save our NHS and Social Care Services","H",NA
"Good health is a prerequisite to taking full advantage of life’s opportunities, and we must do all we can to help people stay healthy as well as provide high-quality care when they are ill.","504",NA
"Mental health is just as important as physical health and we have made it a priority to deliver equality between the two.","504",NA
"The N HS has been the envy of the world, but it is now facing the greatest crisis in its history and we urgently need to increase its funding.","504",NA
"As a country, we are living longer – but that means more people are living with conditions like diabetes and dementia and they need help to live with dignity and the maximum degree of independence.","504",NA
"We must set the highest standards in care, abolishing the artificial boundaries that prevent health and social care services working together.","504",NA
"Health and wellbeing are affected by far more than just the quality of health and social care services, so we will work to improve the wider factors that affect people’s health such as warm homes, clean air and access to exercise and healthy food so that everyone can have the best chance to lead a healthy life.","503",NA
"Our priorities in the next parliament will be: Saving the NHS by putting a penny in the pound on Income Tax to give the NHS and social care services the cash injection they need.","504",NA
"Transforming mental health care with waiting time standards to match those in physical health care.","504",NA
"Home not hospital: better integration of health and social care","504",NA
"and limiting the amount elderly people have to pay for social care.","504",NA
"2.1 Saving the NHS and social care","H",NA
"The N HS and social care services are in a state of crisis.","504",NA
"The Conservatives have left them chronically underfunded, while need continues to grow and patient care suffers.","504",NA
"Social care is facing a funding black hole of £2 billion this year alone","504",NA
"and more than a million older people are missing out on the care they need.","504",NA
"People are routinely left stranded in hospital after they finish their treatment because the follow-up care and support they need is not available.","504",NA
"Nearly two-thirds of N HS trusts ended the last financial year in deficit.","504",NA
"Yet Labour and Conservative politicians refuse to be honest with the public about the scale of the crisis or the tough decisions which are needed to protect these vital services.","305.1",NA
"Liberal Democrats recognise that Britain’s health and social care services are our most treasured national institutions.","504",NA
"Any party seeking to lead the country after this election should be prepared to take bold action to safeguard them.","504",NA
"This isn’t about doing the easiest thing, it is about doing what is right and what is essential.","504",NA
"Liberal Democrats will take five key steps to put our health and social care system back on a sustainable financial footing:","504",NA
"1 . An immediate 1 p rise on the basic, higher and additional rates of Income Tax to raise £6 billion additional revenue, which would be ringfenced to be spent only on N HS and social care services.","504",NA
"Direct this additional investment to the following priority areas in the health and care system: social care, primary care (and other out-of-hospital care), mental health and public health.","504",NA
"This represents the most efficient and effective way of spending these extra resources – ensuring they will have the greatest impact on the quality of care patients receive.","504",NA
"In the longer term and as a replacement for the 1 p Income Tax rise, commission the development of a dedicated health and care tax on the basis of wide consultation, possibly based on a reform of National Insurance contributions, which will bring together spending on both services into a collective budget and set out transparently, on people’s payslips, what we spend on them.","504",NA
"Establish a cross-party health and social care convention, bringing together stakeholders from all political parties, patients groups, the public and professionals from within the health and social care system to carry out a comprehensive review of the longer-term sustainability of the health and social care finances and workforce, and the practicalities of greater integration.","504",NA
"We would invite the devolved administrations to be a part of this work.","301",NA
"Introduce a statutory independent budget monitoring agency for health and care, similar to the Office for Budget Responsibility.","504",NA
"This would report every three years on how much money the system needs to deliver safe and sustainable treatment and care, and how much is needed to meet the costs of projected increases in demand and any new initiatives – to ensure any changes in services are properly costed and affordable.","504",NA
"Our longer-term objective will be to bring together NHS and social care into one seamless service – pooling budgets in every area by 2020 and developing integrated care organisations.","504",NA
"2.2 Valuing the NHS and social care workforce","H",NA
"Our health and social care services’ greatest resource is their staff, working tirelessly under immense pressure.","504",NA
"This Government has left them feeling embattled and undervalued.","305.1",NA
"To support the N HS and social care workforce we will: Guarantee the rights of all N HS and social care service staff who are EU nationals to stay in the UK.","701",NA
"End the public sector pay freeze for NHS workers.","701",NA
"Reinstate student nurse bursaries.","504",NA
"Support innovation in how organisations can empower staff and patients, including learning from innovative social enterprises delivering community and mental health services.","504",NA
"Protect N HS whistle-blowers.","201.2",NA
"GPs in particular have been put under considerable strain due to severe underfunding and neglect from the Conservatives, leaving many people waiting weeks to get appointments.","504",NA
"GPs are the core of what the NHS is and they need su pport to ensure that the N HS is able to su rvive and thrive.","504",NA
"We will:",NA,NA
"Produce a national workforce strategy, ensuring that we never again experience a shortage in the numbers of GPs, hospital doctors, nurses and other professionals that the N HS needs.","504",NA
"2.3 Equal care for mental health","H",NA
"In government, we fought tirelessly to reduce the historic inequality between the way physical and mental health are treated in the NHS and are proud of the strides forward we made.","504",NA
"We legislated to give mental and physical health equality under the law.","504",NA
"We introduced the first waiting time standards for access to treatment for mental health.","504",NA
"We introduced the crisis care concordat which dramatically reduced the number of people who end up in police cells when they experience a mental health crisis;","504",NA
"and we secured more money for children and young people’s mental health services.","504",NA
"But we know that not enough resources reach front-line services and that in the fight for parity of esteem there is still a very long way to go.","504",NA
"We will:",NA,NA
"Ringfence funding from within the one penny Income Tax rise, to provide additional investment in mental health.","504",NA
"Continue to roll out access and waiting time standards for children, young people and adults.","504",NA
"This will include a guarantee that people will not wait more than six weeks for therapy for depression or anxiety","504",NA
"and no young person will wait more than two weeks for treatment when they experience a first episode of psychosis.","504",NA
"Increase access to clinically- and cost-effective talking therapies so that hundreds of thousands more people can receive this support.","504",NA
"Examine the case for introducing a dedicated service for children and Young people based on the Australian ‘headspace’ model and building on many excellent youth information, advice and counselling services.","504",NA
"Transform mental health support for pregnant women, new mothers and those who have experienced miscarriage or stillbirth, and help them get early care when needed.","504",NA
"Continue to promote and invest in the Frontline programme to fast-track exceptional graduates into children’s social work, as well as the Think Ahead scheme aimed at encouraging high-achieving graduates to pursue a career in mental health social work.","504",NA
"Ensure that no one in crisis is turned away, with new waiting time standards and better crisis care in accident and emergency departments, in the community and via phone lines.","504",NA
"This will enable us to end the use of police cells for people facing a mental health crisis.","504",NA
"End out-of-area placements, ensuring those admitted to hospital for mental ill-health are able to be treated close to home.","504",NA
"Ensure that all front-line public service professionals, including in schools and universities, receive better training in mental health.","504",NA
"Roll out the Liaison and Diversion programme nationally, helping to identify people who have mental health problems, learning disabilities, substance misuse or other vulnerabilities when they first come into contact with the criminal justice system.","504",NA
"Tackle stigma against mental ill-health, including by building on the good work done by organisations such as Heads Together","504",NA
"and changing the standard of proof in suicide conclusions in the Coroner’s Court.","504",NA
"Ensure that LGBT+ inclusive mental health services receive funding and support.","504",NA
"Medical research is vital for developing new and better treatments.","411",NA
"We will fight the threat Brexit poses to medical research funding.","411",NA
"We support the principle that all medical trials using public facilities or resources should comply with the Open Trials standards","202.1",NA
"and that a fair proportion of all public funding for medical research should be focused on research into mental ill-health.","504",NA
"We also favour the further development of open access academic journals.","506",NA
"2.4 Home not hospital: joining up health and social care","H",NA
"We need services that fit around people’s lives, not ones that force them to fit their lives around the care they need.","504",NA
"This will become increasingly important as our population ages and the number of people living with long-term conditions grows.","504",NA
"It is also more cost-effective to support people to be able to live at home rather than endure lengthy stays in hospital.","504",NA
"We must move away from a fragmented system to an integrated service with more joined-up care and more personal budgets so that people can design services for their own individual needs.","504",NA
"We believe this should happen from the bottom up, suiting the needs of local communities.","606.2",NA
"The number of family carers is rising, including in the ‘sandwich generation’ who find themselves trying to care for their children and their parents at the same time.","504",NA
"Carers are unsung heroes; we need to do more to help them.","504",NA
"We will: Finish the job of implementing a cap on the cost of social care, which the Conservatives have effectively abandoned.","504",NA
"Move towards single place-based budgets for health and social care by 2020, allowing local areas to decide how best to provide the full spectrum of care for their community.","301",NA
"Remodel the health care funding system to eliminate perverse incentives, by moving away from payments for activity and introducing tariffs that encourage joined-up services and promote improved outcomes for patients and better preventive care.","504",NA
"Ensure those who work in the social care sector are properly trained, with accessible career pathways,","411",NA
"and are suitable to practice by introducing a statutory code of conduct backed up by a care workers’ suitability register.","504",NA
"Raise the amount people can earn before losing Carer’s Allowance from £1 10 to £1 50 a week,","504",NA
"and reduce the number of hours’ care per week required to qualify.","504",NA
"Give the NHS a legal duty to identify carers and develop a Carer’s Passport scheme to inform carers of their NHS rights, such as flexible visiting hours and access to support.","504",NA
"Provide more choice at the end of life and move towards free end-of-life social care, whether people spend their last days at home or in a hospice.","504",NA
"Evaluate the valuable work of hospices with a view to putting them on a more sustainable financial footing and allowing them to expand their services.","504",NA
"2.5 Better access to community services","H",NA
"Most people’s experience of the NHS is their local GP or the nurses and support staff who visit them at home or work in community clinics.","504",NA
"Access to care in GP surgeries and closer to home is better for patients and will also help reduce pressure on hospitals, accident and emergency departments and ambulances.","504",NA
"We will: Promote easier access to GPs, expanding evening and weekend opening to meet the needs of local patients, encouraging online, phone and Skype appointments, encouraging GPs to work together in federations and allowing people more choice.","504",NA
"Provide national support to struggling GP practices, preventing mass practice closures.","504",NA
"Support GPs to come together to collectively provide services such as out-of-norma l-open i ng-hours appointments.","504",NA
"Use innovation funding to promote GP-led multidisciplinary health and care hubs, including mobile services to keep people out of hospital.","504",NA
"Encourage GPs and other community clinicians to work in disadvantaged areas through our Patient Premium – which would give incentive payments to clinicians.","504",NA
"Ensure that any changes to the way pharmacies are funded do not leave local areas without reasonable access to a community pharmacist.","504",NA
"Review the rules for exemption from prescription charges to ensure they are fair to those with long-term conditions and disabilities.","504",NA
"2.6 Helping people stay healthy","H",NA
"It is better for patients and for the NHS if we keep people healthy in the first place, rather than just waiting until people develop illnesses and come for treatment, but 40% of NHS spending is on diseases that are preventable.","504",NA
"We need to do more to promote healthy eating and exercise, making people aware of the dangers of smoking and excessive consumption of alcohol and other drugs, and helping to improve mental health and wellbeing.","504",NA
"We will: Move towards a health and social care system that empowers and encourages people to better manage their own health and conditions and to live healthier lives.","504",NA
"Publish a National Wellbeing Strategy, which puts better health and wellbeing for all at the heart of government policy.","504",NA
"Implement the recommendations of the O’Neill report on antimicrobial resistance to ensure responsible prescribing","504",NA
"and investment in diagnostics and innovation.","411",NA

"Develop a public health campaign promoting the steps people can take to improve their own mental resilience – the wellbeing equivalent of the ‘Five a Day’ ca m pa ign .","504",NA
"Support good practice among employers in promoting wellbeing","504",NA
"and ensure people with mental health problems get the help they need to stay in or find work,","504",NA
"with a ‘wellbeing premium’ to reward employers who take clear action to measurably improve the health of their employees.","504",NA
"We will develop a just settlement for haemophiliacs who were given contaminated blood, and for their families.","504",NA
"3 Put Children First","H",NA
"Liberal Democrats have always put education at the heart of our agenda.","506",NA
"Education opens the mind,","506",NA
"it fosters understanding and tolerance,","202.1",NA
"and it empowers our children","706",NA
"and our communities.","606.1",NA
"We believe every child deserves a great start in life so they are equipped to shape their own future, and are determined to make sure that the education system finds and unleashes the best in everyone.","503",NA
"This is essential in order to break down the unfair divisions in our society,","503",NA
"to ensure a productive, competitive economy","410",NA
"and to overcome intolerance.","503",NA
"Too many people have their chances in life determined by who their parents are rather than by their own efforts and abilities.","503",NA
"With our Pupil Premium, investing in children who might otherwise fall behind, we are finally beginning to tackle the scandalous gap in attainment between rich and poor.","503",NA
"But now the Conservatives want to take us back 50 years, to an outdated system of grammar schools and secondary moderns, ignoring all the research and expert advice that show it will damage the life chances of so many children.","503",NA
"Liberal Democrats recognise the dual role of education in giving young people the knowledge and skills they need to be part of a productive, competitive economy, and helping them grow into happy, healthy and engaged members of their community.","506",NA
"Children’s education is too often distorted by schools’ need to focus on the next set of league tables and the next inspection.","506",NA
"Teachers deserve to be treated as professionals and given the flexibility and support to apply their expertise.","506",NA
"Schools should be free to encourage children to participate in a truly rounded curriculum including the arts, sport and culture that broaden children’s learning and develop their passion for education.","506",NA
"Our priorities in the next parliament will be:",NA,NA
"Investing nearly £7 billion extra in our children’s education – increasing school budgets and the Pupil Premium to protect against rising costs and pupil numbers,","506",NA
"and introducing a fairer national funding formula.","503",NA
"Investing in high-quality early years education, tripling the Early Years Pupil Premium to £1,000.","506",NA
"Opposing any new selective schools","506",NA
"and giving local authorities proper democratic control over admissions and new schools.","301",NA
"3.1 Stop the education cuts – fair funding for every school","H",NA
"Schools in England are facing an unprecedented funding crisis, with rising pupil numbers and an inadequate financial settlement meaning that real-terms per-pupil funding is being squeezed.","506",NA
"At the same time the Conservatives’ flawed approach to the National Fair Funding Formula means some schools will lose out even more.","506",NA
"Liberal Democrats believe every child deserves a high-quality education, wherever they live.","506",NA
"We will: Reverse all cuts to front-line school and college budgets, protecting per-pupil funding in real terms.","506",NA
"Introduce a fairer national funding system with a protection for all schools, so that no school loses money.","506",NA
"Protect the Pupil Premium which targets extra help at disadvantaged children.","506",NA
"Over the parliament, this means nearly £7 billion more for school and college budgets.","506",NA
"3.2 Quality really counts in early years","H",NA
"Investing in high-quality early years education has a huge impact on children’s attainment as they enter school.","506",NA

"We will: Increase our Early Years Pupil Premium to £1,000 per pupil per year.","506",NA
"Raise the quality of early years provision and aim for every formal early years setting to employ at least one person who holds an early years teacher qualification by 2022.","506",NA
"3.3 Teachers – our biggest asset in education","H",NA
"Too many good teachers are leaving the profession – in many cases because of the excessive pressure they are under from heavy workloads and funding cuts.","506",NA
"We want to empower teachers and make sure they feel valued for the essential work they do.","506",NA
"We want to improve the status of the teaching profession, and support and nurture teachers in their work – helping to drive up standards in every school.","506",NA
"We will: End the 1 % cap on teachers’ pay rises.","506",NA
"Guarantee that all teachers in state-funded schools will be fully qualified or working towards qualified teacher status (QTS) from January 2019.","506",NA
"Introduce a clear and properly funded entitlement to genuinely high-quality professional development for all teachers – 25 hours per year by 2020, rising to the OECD average of 50 hours by 2025.","506",NA
"Support proper long-term planning of initial teacher training places, prioritising close partnerships with higher education and specialist routes such as Teach First in order to recruit the highest-quality teachers in shortage areas such as science, technology, engineering, the arts and maths.","506",NA
"Tackle unnecessary teacher workloads, including by:Establishing an independent Education Standards Authority to pilot, phase in and resource future policy changes in consultation with professionals and experts.","506",NA

"3.4 Driving up school standards","H",NA
"Far too many children are still failing to get the opportunities they need.","503",NA
"We cannot fail our children – especially when we know it is the children who need the most help who are the most likely to be let down.","503",NA
"The Conservatives’ obsession with more grammar schools is not the answer.","506",NA
"Liberal Democrats want to give every child the chance of attending an excellent local school.","503",NA
"We will: Give democratically accountable local authorities clear responsibility for local school places planning","301",NA
"and repeal the rule that all new state-funded schools must be free schools or academies.","506",NA
"We will encourage local head teachers with a strong record to play a key role in school improvement, working with schools and local authorities.","506",NA
"Scrap the planned expansion of grammar schools","503",NA
"and devolve all capital monies for new school spaces to local authorities.","301",NA
"Allow Ofsted to inspect both local authorities and academy chains.","506",NA
"Rule out state-funded profit-making schools","506",NA
"and ensure that new schools are built in areas where there is a need for new school places, instead of wasting money on oversupply.","506",NA
"Ensure that identification and support for special educational needs and disabilities takes place as early as possible.","506",NA
"All new policies should have an assessment of how they affect pupils who have special educational needs, and ensure they adhere to duties under the Equality Act.","503",NA
"3.5 Curriculum and qualifications","H",NA
"We want schools to have flexibility, but we also believe that parents and children need to know that the curriculum in every school will cover the essentials, and that teachers will be skilled educators who know how to inspire a love of learning.","506",NA
"Education should equip children with rich knowledge for life, nurturing creativity and problem-solving, and instilling a passion for lifelong learning.","506",NA
"Children should be helped to develop the life skills they will need as adults, and every pupil should be given advice and guidance about their future.","506",NA
"We will: Introduce a curriculum entitlement – a slimmed down core national curriculum, which will be taught in all state-funded schools.","506",NA
"This will include Personal, Social and Health Education: a ‘curriculum for life’ including financial literacy, first aid and emergency lifesaving skills, mental health education, citizenship and age-appropriate Sex and Relationship Education (SRE).","506",NA

"It is no longer the case that the skills learned at 18 or 21 will last throughout a career.","411",NA
"The ability to learn new skills or change careers is also vital in creating the opportunity for people to succeed no matter their stage in life.","503",NA

"Machine learning, artificial intelligence and automation are affecting the type and the scale of employment.","411",NA
"New global markets are opening up for low-carbon and resource-efficient goods, services and infrastructure.","411",NA
"The scope and speed of these changes will be profound and rapid.","411",NA
"Britain needs a sustainable and balanced economy not just to help fund public services","416.2",NA
"but because growth and enterprise create jobs and opportunities for all.","503",NA
"Liberal Democrats believe that there is much to be done to create an economy that ensures that the whole population benefits from the technological advances ahead.","503",NA
"We will work to support growth now and put in place a sustainable economy that will create growth for the future","416.2",NA
"– an economy that works for the long term:","416.2",NA
"prosperous,","410",NA
"green,","416.2",NA
"open","401",NA
"and fair.","403",NA
"The actions of the Conservatives have undermined the Coalition’s work in fixing the economy.","305.1",NA
"They have chosen to risk the long-term future of our economy by limiting vital spending on infrastructure","411",NA
"and creating an over-reliance on consumer spending fuelled by debt to prop up growth.","414",NA
"They have consistently put their own short-term ambition above long-term economic prosperity.","305.1",NA
"Above all, their disastrous determination to pursue a hard Brexit casts a shadow over our economic future.","108",NA
"As a result, our economy is at its most fragile since the 2008 crash.","305.1",NA
"We need a radical programme of investment to boost growth,","410",NA
"develop new infrastructure fit for the future","411",NA
"and get our economy back on track.","414",NA
"Our priorities in the next parliament will be: Boosting the economy with a major programme of capital investment aimed at stimulating growth across all areas of the UK.","410",NA
"Eliminating the deficit on day-to-day spending by 2020 to control the national debt, and then borrowing only to invest.","414",NA
"Ensuring strong public services by investing the proceeds of a 1 p rise in Income Tax in the NHS and social care,","504",NA
"and commiting to protecting the schools budget in real terms.","506",NA
"4.1 Responsible finances: investing in Britain’s future","H",NA
"Liberal Democrats reject the Conservative Government’s damaging and irrational commitment to run budget surpluses on both capital and revenue,","414",NA
"which imposes completely unnecessary deep cuts in spending","414",NA
"and limits the scope for much-needed capital investment.","402",NA
"But we have no intention of just throwing away our hard-fought efforts to control the deficit during the Coalition years.","414",NA
"Liberal Democrats will therefore commit to eliminating the deficit in day-to-day spending by 2020.","414",NA
"This means we will be able to keep debt as a share of national wealth falling through the parliament, unless there is a recession.","414",NA
"Once we have brought current expenditure into balance we will ensure that overall public spending grows roughly in line with the economy.","414",NA
"This means that we can improve key public services and provide them with the investment they need.","504",NA
"A long-term stable economy requires more than just discipline over spending.","411",NA
"It requires us to invest in people, innovation and infrastructure in order to give our economy the opportunity to remain competitive for the future.","411",NA
"The Conservatives have failed to take advantage of historically low interest rates to borrow for the investment that would create jobs now","701",NA
"and prepare us and our economy for the future.","411",NA
"Liberal Democrats will therefore commit to a responsible and realistic £1 00 billion package of additional infrastructure investment.","411",NA
"This will prioritise: New direct spending on housebuilding to help build 300,000 homes a year by 2022.","411",NA
"A programme of installing hyperfast, fibre-optic broadband across the U K.","411",NA

"We will ensure that the National Infrastructure Commission takes fully into account the environmental implications of all national infrastructure decisions.","501",NA
"We will also devolve significant infrastructure spending to local areas.","301",NA
"Our investment in new infrastructure is matched by our commitment to protecting vital public services, including the NHS","504",NA
"and education.","506",NA
"We will make the difficult decisions needed to ensure our NHS is protected for the long term","504",NA
"and that children are given the opportunities they need to succeed.","503",NA
"We will therefore commit to: Increase spending on the N HS and social care, using the proceeds of a 1 p rise in Income Tax.","504",NA
"This will be paid by taxpayers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and the revenue will be ringfenced for spending on NHS and social care services in England, with the appropriate share also being transferred to Wales and Northern Ireland.","504",NA
"This taxation will be neither levied nor spent in Scotland.","301",NA
"There will be a commensurate 1 p increase in dividend taxation which is a U K-wide tax.","504",NA
"The receipts of this will be similarly earmarked, with Scotland also receiving its share.","504",NA
"Protect the education budget in real terms per pupil from early years to age 19.","506",NA
"End the 1 % cap on pay rises in the public sector,","504",NA
"and uprate wages in line with inflation.","412",NA
"The Conservative pursuit of hard Brexit will have serious impacts on the UK’s national finances – impacts which current government plans may not fully take into account.","108",NA
"Liberal Democrats would choose to pursue a very different European policy, and therefore would expect a better financial situation.","108",NA
"We will initiate a spending review after the general election focusing on delivering efficiency,","303",NA
"funding proven spend-to-save initiatives,","303",NA
"pursuing local and community integration to drive efficiency,","301",NA
"and investing in technology to get public services and front-line staff online.","303",NA
"Traditional indicators of economic activity such as GDP are poor guides to genuine prosperity and wellbeing.","504",NA
"We will therefore introduce a National Wellbeing Strategy covering all aspects of government policy, including health, housing and the environment.","504",NA
"4.2 Fair taxes","H",NA
"In order to balance the books and build a sustainable economy for the future we must ensure that everyone pays their fair share.","503",NA
"Liberal Democrats have a long-standing commitment to fairer taxation, and in government we raised the personal allowance for Income Tax.","503",NA
"It remains our ambition to make taxes fairer","503",NA
"and simpler,","303",NA
"to help those on low and middle incomes,","701",NA
"and to ensure that those on the highest incomes, and large international companies, make a fair contribution.","503",NA
"We will: Aim in the long term, and as resources allow, to raise the employee national insurance threshold to the Income Tax threshold,","504",NA
"while protecting low earners’ ability to accrue pension and benefit entitlements.","504",NA
"Ensure those with the highest incomes and wealth are making a fair contribution.","503",NA
"We have identified a series of distortions, loopholes and excessive reliefs that should be removed.","503",NA
"These include reforms to Capital Gains Tax and dividend tax relief, and refocusing entrepreneurs’ relief.","408",NA
"We would reverse a number of the Conservatives’ unfair and unjustified tax cuts, including: The cutting of Corporation Tax from 20% to 17%.","503",NA

"Capital Gains Tax extended relief.","403",NA
"The Marriage Allowance.","604",NA
"The raising of the Inheritance Tax threshold.","503",NA

"Reforming Corporation Tax to develop a system that benefits the smallest companies while ensuring the biggest multinationals cannot avoid paying sums comparable to nationally based competitors.","402",NA
"We will consult on shifting away from a profits-based tax to one that takes account of a wider range of economic activity indicators, such as sales and turnover.","403",NA

"4.3 Supporting entrepreneurs and small business","H",NA
"As well as the need for public infrastructure investment, the role of entrepreneurs and small businesses in delivering a thriving economy is fundamental.","402",NA
"Liberal Democrats believe there is a vital need for access to finance for new businesses, and those wishing to scale up.","402",NA
"Creating true competition means allowing new businesses to rise and challenge established companies.","402",NA
"There are also many well-established small businesses and traders which form the backbone of local economies.","402",NA
"Our priority in supporting entrepreneurs and small businesses is to ensure that they have access to the funding they need, and in particular long-term (and patient) capital.","402",NA
"We will: Expand the activities of the state-owned British Business Bank, enabling it to perform a more central role in the economy by tackling the shortage of equity capital for growing firms and providing long-term capital for medium-sized businesses.","402",NA

"The government needs to act now to ensure this technological march can benefit everyone and that no areas are left in technology’s wake.","411",NA
"We will: Protect the science budget, including the recent £2 billion increase, by continuing to raise it at least in line with inflation.","411",NA
"Our long-term goal is to double innovation and research spending across the economy.","411",NA
"We would guarantee to underwrite funding for British partners in EU-funded projects such as Horizon 2020 who would suffer from cancellation of income on Brexit.","411",NA
"Build on the Coalition’s industrial strategy, working with sectors which are critical to Britain’s ability to trade internationally,","411",NA

"4.5 Helping everyone earn a decent living","H",NA
"Most businesses recognise the long-term value in treating their employers decently and developing their skills.","701",NA

"A well-functioning economy which works for everyone cannot be based solely on companies owned by and operated on behalf of small groups of shareholders.","503",NA

"6.5 Building more and better homes","H",NA
"The housing crisis in Britain has become an emergency.","504",NA

"That is why we have set an ambitious target of increasing the rate of housebuilding to 300,000 a year – almost double the current level.","411",NA

"We will: Introduce votes at 16 for all elections and referendums across the UK.","202.1",NA

"Strengthen trade union members’ political freedoms by letting them choose which political party they wish to support through the political levy.","701",NA
"Cancel the boundary review due to report in 2018.","202.1",NA
"While new constituencies would need to be established for a new voting system, we believe constituency boundary reviews should respect natural geographical communities, with greater flexibility for the Boundary Commission to deviate from exact equality to take account of community ties and continuity of representation, and should take place every 10 years.","202.1",NA

"The recent media, police and Electoral Commission investigations into possible breaches of spending limits by candidates in the 2015 general election show that the current system is not fit for purpose.","303",NA
"The clear objective must be to ensure that all expenditure on campaign material targeted at an identifiable constituency, and in particular at voters within that constituency, is included in its expense return, rather than it being possible to count against a national party limit.","304",NA
"We do not believe that political parties themselves have an incentive to change the existing system.","304",NA
"We will therefore task the Electoral Commission with producing a framework for an up-to-date expenses system that adequately governs the running of a modern campaign,","303",NA

"Change has been taking place rapidly.","301",NA

"We will work with devolved parliaments and assemblies to allocate to them any powers repatriated as a result of Brexit in their areas of responsibility,","301",NA

"9.4 Wales","H",NA
"We welcome the new Wales Act, which is intended to implement the St David’s Day agreement secured by Liberal Democrats in government – but it does not go far enough.","301",NA

"We will drastically reduce the number of reserved subjects and prevent Westminster from being able to override Wales on devolved matters.","301",NA
"We will recognise Wales as a distinct legal jurisdiction.","301",NA

"9.6 England","H",NA
"Devolution of power to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland has implications for the UK parliament and its dual role in legislating for England as well as the federal UK.","301",NA

"This would be a key issue for our proposed constitutional convention to address.","202.1",NA
"Liberal Democrats support an English-only stage in legislation affecting England, so English MPs can have a separate say on laws that only affect England.","301",NA

"In some areas of England there is a greater appetite for powers, but not every part of the country wants to move at the same speed and there cannot be a one-sizefits-all approach.","202.1",NA
"All areas should however have access to the same opportunities and mayoral authorities should not be ranked higher in terms of the powers with which they can be granted.","202.1",NA
