"Introduction","H",NA
"The Liberal Democrats are the only party contesting this election with a clear plan for how we will build a brighter future.","305.1",NA
"The first step of our plan for a brighter future is simple: stop Brexit","108",NA
"and use the Remain Bonus to invest in public services.","504",NA
"We are unashamedly fighting to stay in the European Union,","108",NA
"and we are the strongest party of Remain.","108",NA
"We believe that our best future as a country is as a member of the European Union.","108",NA
"Any form of Brexit will damage our economy, put jobs at risk, hurt our NHS and put our family of nations under enormous strain.","108",NA
"There is no Brexit deal that will ever be as good as the deal we currently have as a member of the European Union.","108",NA
"Our determination to stop Brexit isn’t just about retaining membership of this or that EU institution.","108",NA
"It’s about who we are as a country and the values that drive our choices.","601.1",NA
"It’s about choosing to work with others in taking on the big challenges that we face, whether it’s the climate crisis or cybercrime.","107",NA
"It’s about recognising that the zero-sum games of the past no longer apply to a world where our future prosperity is so interlinked with that of our closest allies.","107",NA
"Staying in the European Union will secure a £50 billion Remain Bonus, with the economy two per cent larger by 2024-25.","108",NA
"We can invest that bonus in our schools,","506",NA
"and on tackling in-work poverty and inequality.","503",NA
"A Liberal Democrat government will take urgent action to save our planet.","501",NA
"We are the last generation that can stop irreversible climate change.","501",NA
"We’ve already seen how floods and wildfires are becoming an ever more regular occurrence in our country.","501",NA
"And, though we should be proud to be the first country to declare a climate emergency,","501",NA
"we cannot ignore the fact that the government has done little else since then.","501",NA
"In the meantime, it’s been young people who have consistently put the climate crisis back on the agenda with their inspirational climate strikes.","501",NA
"The Liberal Democrats are the only party with a radical, credible and detailed plan to tackle the climate emergency as soon as possible.","501",NA
"We will deliver a ten-year emergency programme to cut greenhouse gas emissions substantially straightaway","501",NA
"and phase out emissions from the remaining hard-to-treat sectors by 2045 at the latest.","501",NA
"By 2030 we will generate 80 per cent of our electricity from renewables","501",NA
"and cut energy bills and emissions by insulating homes,","501",NA
"prioritising bringing 3.5 million households out of fuel poverty by 2025.","503",NA
"In government, we will give every child the best start in life, no matter their ability or background, and we will empower them to make the most of the challenges ahead.","503",NA
"But currently too many of our schools are falling behind, teaching assistants are being laid off","506",NA
"and cash-strapped councils are struggling to support children with complex needs.","506",NA
"Liberal Democrats will invest in schools to build a brighter future for our children.","506",NA
"We will reverse school cuts with an emergency cash injection so that pupils have the resources they need to learn.","506",NA
"We will increase teacher numbers by 20,000 and let them get on with their jobs, instead of worrying about budgeting for the basics.","506",NA
"We will create a fairer economy, where every person can live a secure, happy and fulfilling life.","503",NA
"To do that, we will provide free childcare for all children with parents in work from nine months","504",NA
"and for all children from two years, up to the time they start school.","504",NA
"This will plug the gap in provision, ensuring that parents have an easier choice when it comes to returning to work after parental leave.","504",NA
"The great advancements in technology and the ever-changing nature of the world of work mean that more of us will change careers throughout our lives.","506",NA
"And it simply isn’t good enough to say that education stops after school or university.","506",NA
"A Liberal Democrat government will set up a new Skills Wallet for every adult, giving people £10,000 to spend on approved education and training courses to gain the right skills for the jobs of the future.","506",NA
"Creating a fairer economy is about reinventing the relationship between business and the communities in which they operate, so that they are part of the solution to our biggest challenges, not the problem.","503",NA
"Finally, we will transform our mental health service by treating it with the same urgency as physical health.","504",NA
"About one in four people in the UK experience a mental health problem each year, and while the NHS may be the envy of the world, our mental health service falls far short of what patients deserve.","504",NA
"Nearly two-thirds of children and young people with diagnosable mental health conditions are not receiving treatment,","504",NA
"and waiting times for psychological therapy can range from just over two weeks to six months, depending on where you are in the country.","504",NA
"Over the next Parliament, a Liberal Democrat government will invest £11 billion in mental health to expand access to therapies","504",NA
"and increase the number of psychiatrists and specialist mental health practitioners.","504",NA
"We will make mental health services 24- hour, including placing mental health liaison teams in all hospitals so that those facing a mental health crisis are not put in police cells.","504",NA
"This is the Liberal Democrat plan for a brighter future.","305.1",NA
"Stop Brexit","H",NA
"Every vote for the Liberal Democrats is a vote to stop Brexit and stay in the European Union.","108",NA
"For over three years Liberal Democrats have led the fight to stop Brexit.","108",NA
"We campaigned to stay in the EU in 2016 and we unequivocally believe that the UK is stronger as part of the EU.","108",NA
"The election of a Liberal Democrat majority government on a clear stop Brexit platform will provide a democratic mandate to stop this mess, revoke Article 50 and stay in the EU.","108",NA
"In other circumstances, we will continue to fight for a people’s vote with the option to stay in the EU,","108",NA
"and in that vote we would passionately campaign to keep the UK in the EU.","108",NA
"Electing a Liberal Democrat government is the only way to get the Brexit process over.","108",NA
"Although the Conservatives claim that a vote for them will ‘get Brexit done’, it won’t:","305.1",NA
"it will simply usher in more years of difficult negotiations over the UK’s trade deal with the EU, with a very high chance of Britain crashing out and trying to survive on so-called ‘WTO terms’ – a deal so bad that almost no other country anywhere in the world trades on that basis.","108",NA
"Labour want to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement all over again and negotiate a new deal – but they will not say whether they want Britain to remain in the EU or leave.","305.1",NA
"The fact is that whether Labour Red or Tory Blue, Brexit is bad for the UK.","108",NA
"The importance of the UK’s membership of the EU has never been clearer.","108",NA
"Working together through the EU, the countries of Europe have achieved peace and prosperity on a continent historically wracked by war and division.","108",NA
"That is a tremendous achievement; it should not be taken for granted, particularly as Europe faces new dangers from an increasingly aggressive Russia and as the US turns away from its old alliances.","108",NA
"Many of the great challenges of the 21st century are global: climate change, human trafficking, the arms trade, the power of multinationals, global poverty and inequality.","108",NA
"By separating itself from the EU, Britain diminishes its capacity to respond to these threats.","108",NA
"By working together with our European neighbours, we increase the UK’s ability to meet those challenges: for example, in international negotiations, in regulating the tech giants or in creating markets for climate-friendly products.","108",NA
"There is no doubt that full membership of the EU is good for the British economy.","108",NA
"Brexit would bring to an end businesses’ unfettered access to the European single market – the destination of almost half of Britain’s exports – and to the smooth flow of goods that complex industrial supply chains require.","108",NA
"The prospect of tariffs and border checks is already causing manufacturers to shift their operations to other EU states and UK manufacturers are already reporting that export orders have dried up.","108",NA
"There is no prospect of replacing lost EU markets with free trade agreements with other countries thousands of miles away.","108",NA
"If the UK gives in to President Trump’s demands to lower environmental and health standards for a trade deal with the US, we would lose the ability to export to the EU,","108",NA
"which would drive many British businesses, including most farmers, out of business.","108",NA
"Brexit is bad for jobs,","108",NA
"growth and prosperity.","108",NA
"Brexit will also mean an end to freedom of movement, which has brought the UK tremendous social, economic and cultural benefits.","108",NA
"It gives British people the opportunity to work, be together with their loved ones, study and retire anywhere in the EU.","108",NA
"There is no contradiction between our European and our British, national and regional identities: they enrich one another.","108",NA
"By stopping Brexit, Liberal Democrats will protect and maintain freedom of movement, safeguarding the rights of UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens in the UK.","108",NA
"Liberal Democrats will also support the right of the people of Gibraltar to remain in the European Union.","108",NA
"EU citizens are valued members of our communities and we believe that they should be afforded the right to full participation in civic life, including the ability to stand for office and vote in UK referendums, European elections and general elections as well as local elections.","108",NA
"Liberal Democrats will extend these rights to all EU citizens who have lived in the UK for five years or longer.","108",NA
"To ensure that EU citizens are not denied their vote in any election or referendum, we will also implement urgent electoral law reform, in line with the Electoral Commission’s 2014 recommendations,","108",NA
"including introducing a legal requirement for councils to inform citizens of the steps they must take to be successfully registered","202.1",NA
"and making the necessary changes to ensure that the UK has an automatic system of inclusion in elections.","202.1",NA
"The national humiliation of Brexit puts so much at risk – the NHS, public services, jobs across the country, scientific collaboration, peace in Northern Ireland, the unity of the UK, our ability to tackle global crises such as climate change and our global reputation as a country that is confident and outward-facing.","108",NA
"By keeping the UK in the EU, we can get on with tackling the real issues facing our country,","108",NA
"using the Remain Bonus of £50 billion to invest in public services","504",NA
"and tackle inequality.","503",NA
"A Liberal Democrat government will stop Brexit – and build a brighter future for the UK by keeping us at the heart of the European Union.","108",NA
"Our Plan for a Stronger Economy","H",NA
"People who work hard and contribute to society should have good, fulfilling and well- paid jobs.","701",NA
"Businesses and entrepreneurs who innovate and invest and behave responsibly to their employees and to the environment should be supported.","416.2",NA
"But this is not how the UK is today: too many people can’t get on, and live secure, happy and fulfilling lives.","503",NA
"The failure of governments to invest in infrastructure and skills has undermined productivity,","411",NA
"and now the Conservatives threaten to make the vast majority of people poorer","503",NA
"and punish business and enterprise through a hard Brexit.","108",NA
"Meanwhile, we are facing profound economic changes that demand new partnerships between government and business:,","402",NA
"the emergence of artificial intelligence requires new approaches to work","411",NA
"and the challenge of transitioning to a zero-carbon economy must be managed in a way that does not hurt the least well-off","503",NA
"and makes the UK more competitive.","402",NA
"The UK’s strengths in science, financial services, the creative industries and high-tech manufacturing mean that we should be well placed to build an economy that treats business as part of the solution","402",NA
"and spreads opportunity to everyone.","503",NA
"However, neither Labour nor the Conservatives are capable of guiding the economy through these challenges.","305.1",NA
"Both parties are reaching to the past for answers that are no longer relevant.","305.1",NA
"The Conservatives are pursuing a deregulated, low-tax Brexit that will set our economy back for generations;","410",NA
"Labour are facilitating Brexit while seeking to renationalise their way back to a form of 1970s socialism.","401",NA
"Liberal Democrats are now the natural home of business: we are the only party with a new plan for a brighter economic future.","402",NA
"A plan to invest in climate-friendly infrastructure and technology","411",NA
"and create new green businesses","416.2",NA
"and jobs;","701",NA
"a plan to build on our scientific, technological and creative strengths;","411",NA
"a plan to stop Brexit","108",NA
"and build a more prosperous, equal and inclusive economy.","503",NA
"Whichever part of the country people are from and whatever stage of their career they are at, our plan will mean greater opportunities","503",NA
"and good, well-paid jobs.","701",NA
"Our priorities in the next parliament will be: Investing £130 billion in infrastructure – upgrading our transport and energy systems,","411",NA
"building schools,","506",NA
"hospitals and homes,","504",NA
"empowering all regions and nations of the UK","503",NA
"and developing the climate-friendly infrastructure of the future.","416.2",NA
"Enabling an adaptable, future-focused workforce// –","701",NA
"empowering individuals through new Skills Wallets worth £10,000 for every individual.","411",NA
"Introducing a wellbeing budget and basing decisions for government spending on what will improve wellbeing as well as on economic and fiscal indicators.","504",NA
"Investment for the Future across the UK","H",NA
"Opportunity and access to education, employment and services are not fairly spread around the country.","503",NA
"This means that many people become stuck in insecure work in which they have no prospect of promotion.","701",NA
"The Conservatives pay lip service to the idea of regional growth","305.1",NA
"while pursuing a reckless Brexit that will deepen inequality","503",NA
"and place trade barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK;","406",NA
"Labour’s backwards-looking approach of Whitehall running renationalised industries denies people and communities autonomy and will hit investment and stifle innovation.","401",NA
"Liberal Democrats are the only party looking to the future with a plan to kickstart adevolution revolution that will give all parts of the UK a real say backed by meaningful financial muscle.","301",NA
"This is the only sustainable answer to the regional divide. We will:Give local authorities and regions the power to make decisions about their areas.","301",NA
"Introduce a capital £50 billion Regional Rebalancing Programme for infrastructure spend across the nations and regions of the UK,","301",NA
"with local and devolved authorities given a say in how it is used,","301",NA
"reinforced by a Just Transition Fund to support communities negatively affected by policies to tackle the climate emergency.","301",NA
"Continue to champion investment in the Northern Powerhouse and the Midlands Engine,","301",NA
"putting significant capital resources into infrastructure projects across these regions.","411",NA
"Set an ambitious National Industrial Strategy to transform the economy","410",NA
"and develop Local Industrial Strategies within it that incentivise clustering by businesses and universities with particular specialisations.","402",NA
"Work with the major banks to fund the creation of a local banking sector dedicated to meeting the needs of local small and medium-sized businesses.","402",NA
"Expand the British Business Bank to perform a more central role in the economy, to ensure that viable small and medium-sized businesses have access to capital, even when the rest of the commercial banking system can’t provide it.","402",NA
"Support the tourist industry which is vital for many local economies by:","410",NA
"Upgrading the status of tourism within government, by creating a Department of Digital, Culture, Media, Sport and Tourism, with a designated Minister of State for Tourism.","410",NA
"Enabling local authorities to bring in tourist levies to fund local tourism infrastructure.","402",NA
"Liberal Democrats want to take advantage of historically low interest rates to increase borrowing for investment to build the economy of the future.","410",NA
"We are committed to a responsible and realistic £130 billion package of additional infrastructure investment, which will prioritise:","411",NA
"Significant investment in public transport, including converting the rail network to ultra-low-emission technology (electric or hydrogen) by 2035,","411",NA
"and a continued commitment to HS2, Crossrail 2 and other major new strategic rail routes.","411",NA

"– with a particular focus on connecting rural areas.","411",NA

"including 100,000 social homes.","504",NA

"and ending fuel poverty.","503",NA

"£5 billion of initial capital for a new Green Investment Bank,","416.2",NA
"using public money to attract private investment for zero-carbon priorities.","416.2",NA
"We will ensure that the National Infrastructure Commission takes fully into account the climate and environmental implications of all national infrastructure decisions.","416.2",NA
"UK2050: Our Vision for an Innovation-Led Economy","H",NA
"We want to lay the foundations for the UK to be the best place in the world for innovation-led businesses in the long-term – to be a place where people come from across the EU and the world to turn their ideas into reality.","402",NA
"But with R&D and innovation investment lagging behind other countries and being overly concentrated in South East England, it needs major change to make this vision a reality.","402",NA
"Only the Liberal Democrats can deliver this; the Conservatives are harking back to a romanticised imperial past,","305.1",NA
"while pursuing a Brexit that will hit research and innovation, which is so dependent on European and other international collaboration,","108",NA
"while Labour has no plan for the economy of the future.","305.1",NA
"Liberal Democrats have a transformative plan to make the UK a world leader in responsible innovation by taking advantage of the UK’s strengths and what we are good at as a nation:","601.1",NA
"our natural advantages in renewable energy;  our strong university sector  and our regional strengths such as bioscience in the Midlands, advanced materials in Yorkshire, zero-carbon technology in the North West and photonics in Scotland.","416.2",NA
"We will build a growing economy in which people will have well-paid and fulfilling jobs.","701",NA
"We will: Increase national spending on research and development to three per cent of GDP.","411",NA

"creating more ‘Catapult’ innovation and technology centres","411",NA
"and backing private investment in particular in zero-carbon and environmental innovation.","416.2",NA
"Develop the skilled workforce needed to support this growth by introducing a new two-year visa for students to work after graduation","411",NA
"and a major expansion of high-quality apprenticeships including Higher Apprenticeships, backed up by new sector-led National Colleges.","411",NA

"and are designed to enable the use of smart technologies.","411",NA

"Support growth in the creative industries, including video gaming, by continuing to support the Creative Industries Council","402",NA
"and tailored industry-specific tax support, promoting creative skills,","402",NA

"and addressing the barriers to finance faced by small creative businesses.","402",NA
"Create creative enterprise zones to grow and regenerate the cultural output of areas across the UK.","402",NA

"We will invest in education to equip people with the skills they need – whether to use new technology or to create it","411",NA
"– while also attracting and welcoming the best talent from around the world.","411",NA
"We will enable innovators and entrepreneurs to experiment and take risks,","402",NA
"while taking on concentrations of power that stifle competition, limit choice for consumers and hamper progress.","403",NA
"And we will ensure that new technology is developed and deployed ethically, so that it respects people’s fundamental rights, including the rights to privacy and non-discrimination.","416.2",NA
"We will: Support the UK’s diverse, inclusive tech sector by teaching core skills such as logic, verbal reasoning and creativity in schools,","411",NA
"and by reforming immigration rules – including enabling industry bodies to sponsor work visas.","602.2",NA

"Enable people whose jobs are affected by automation to gain new skills and retrain with our new Skills Wallets,","411",NA
"so that they can work in the good, well- paying jobs of the future.","411",NA
"A Better Deal for Entrepreneurs and Small Business","H",NA
"Dynamic, entrepreneurial businesses are a force for good: entrepreneurs, the self- employed and small businesses form the backbone of local economies and government should support them.","402",NA
"However, the Conservatives are pursuing policies that make it harder to start successful new businesses","402",NA
"and Labour do not understand or value start-ups and small businesses.","402",NA
"Liberal Democrats are the only party who understand the importance of these businesses and who will ensure that they have the access to funding and long-term capital that they need.","402",NA
"We will: Create a new ‘start-up allowance’ to help those starting a new business with their living costs in the crucial first weeks of their business.","402",NA

"Help protect our high streets and town centres by scrapping the rule which allows developers to convert offices and shops into residential properties without planning permission.","403",NA
"Better Business","H",NA
"Business can be a force for good in our economy: we need thriving businesses to create wealth  and a model of responsible capitalism generates good jobs,  shares prosperity and sees businesses promote rights and protect the environment.","416.2",NA
"But the system is not working as it should: unscrupulous employers are still able to exploit their workforce and even when businesses fail, those at the top often receive huge rewards while staff lose their jobs.","503",NA
"And we do not yet have a framework that sufficiently rewards businesses for environmentally sustainable behaviour","416.2",NA
"– or penalises them for environmentally damaging activities.","416.2",NA
"Labour do not recognise the good that business can do;","416.2",NA
"the Conservatives don’t care about the consequences of businesses that are run irresponsibly.","416.2",NA
"Only the Liberal Democrats will promote responsible capitalism that works for the future.","305.1",NA
"Our plan is for an economy that works for everyone,","503",NA
"fosters a diversity of types of business – mutuals, social enterprises and community interest companies–","403",NA
"and empowers employees.","701",NA
"We will:Encourage employers to promote employee ownership by giving staff in listed companies with more than 250 employees a right to request shares, to be held in trust for the benefit of employees.","503",NA
"Strengthen worker participation in decision-making, including staff representation on remuneration committees,","701",NA
"and require all UK-listed companies and all private companies with more than 250 employees to have at least one employee representative on their boards with the same legal duties and responsibilities as other directors.","503",NA
"Introduce a general duty of care for the environment","501",NA
"and human rights – requiring companies, financial institutions and public sector agencies to exercise due diligence in avoiding specified activities such as child labour or modern slavery,","201.2",NA
"or specified products such as commodities produced with deforestation, in their operations and supply chains, and to report on their actions.","416.2",NA
"Reform fiduciary duty and company purpose rules to ensure that all large companies have a formal statement of corporate purpose, including considerations such as employee welfare,","701",NA
"environmental standards,","416.2",NA
"community benefit and ethical practice, alongside benefit to shareholders,","416.2",NA
"and that they report formally on the wider impact of the business on society and the environment.","416.2",NA
"Encourage new forms of incorporation and a diversity of business types, such as for large firms contracting with the public sector or providing essential utilities","405",NA
"and for smaller firms wanting a dual purpose to be profit-making and have a positive impact on society, workers, communities and the environment.","416.2",NA
"Require binding and public votes of shareholders on executive pay policies.","403",NA
"Extend the scope of the existing ‘public interest’ test when considering approvals for takeovers of large or strategically significant companies by overseas-based owners to recognise the benefits to the UK economy, workers and consumers of protecting UK companies from speculative or short-term interests.","403",NA
"Fair Taxes","H",NA
"Government must ensure the tax system meets the needs of a modern economy and is ready for the transition to a digital and zero-carbon economy.","416.2",NA
"Businesses and individuals who benefit from being based in the UK should pay their fair share in tax – and responsible businesses are willing to do this.","403",NA
"They benefit from public goods such as an educated workforce, a stable economy and publicly-funded infrastructure, and it is right that they should contribute towards them.","403",NA
"But the taxation system is unbalanced and unfair: it is too easy for tech giants and large monopolies to avoid tax","403",NA
"and income from employment is taxed more harshly than income generated by wealth.","403",NA
"Labour and the Conservatives are looking to the past for answers that will not work today: Labour want to hike up income tax in a way that will not even ensure that more tax is paid;","305.1",NA
"the Conservatives have no interest in making the taxation system fairer.","503",NA
"Our plan for the future will see big businesses paying their fair share,","503",NA
"support small- and medium-sized enterprises","402",NA
"and ensure that income earned from wealth is not privileged when compared to income from employment – making sure the tax system is fair to all.","503",NA
"We will: Restore Corporation Tax to 20 per cent – reversing the Conservatives’ reduction of this tax to 17 per cent – and keep the rate stable with a predictable future path.","503",NA
"Taxing income from capital more fairly compared to income from work by abolishing the separate Capital Gains Tax-free allowance and instead taxing capital gains and salaries through a single allowance.","503",NA
"Simplify business taxation to lower administration costs  – supporting smaller companies","402",NA
"– and reduce opportunities for tax avoidance.","403",NA
"Replace Business Rates in England with a Commercial Landowner Levy based solely on the land value of commercial sites rather than their entire capital value, thereby stimulating investment, and shifting the burden of taxation from tenants to landowners.","402",NA

"They have cut school and college budgets to the bone.","506",NA

"Parents should get the full picture of how their school is doing.","506",NA
"Primary schools cannot be properly measured by just one week of tests.","506",NA
"There must be robust inspections that measure social and emotional development alongside attainment.","506",NA

"Nurseries are struggling.","504",NA
"With no government support for most families between the end of parental leave and age three, and the average price for 25 hours a week of nursery childcare for a child under two now at £6,600 a year, too many new parents are forced to choose between caring for their child and their careers.","504",NA
"At the same time, the achievement gap between richer and poorer, which can best be tackled in the early years, is rising.","503",NA
"The Conservatives have promised to help, but their childcare policy only covers three- and four-year-olds in working families, only amounts to 30 hours a week – less time than children spend in school – and doesn’t cover school holidays.","504",NA
"Even the hours they do offer are underfunded and this means that many providers struggle to deliver a quality Early Years education.","504",NA
"Many parents who want to work, especially mothers, can spend several years out of the workplace because they can’t afford childcare.","504",NA
"This affects their career trajectory, their confidence, and their long-term earning potential.","503",NA
"Liberal Democrats have a plan to deliver the best start in life for children: free high- quality childcare from nine months for all working parents, properly funded.","504",NA
"Parents wanting to go back to work will get the help they need, knowing that their child will be happy, healthy and ready to start school.","504",NA
"And by tripling the Early Years Pupil Premium and expanding Children’s Centres, we can give further help to the most disadvantaged children, narrowing the achievement gap.","503",NA
"We will: Offer free, high-quality childcare for every child aged two to four and children aged between nine and 24 months where their parents or guardians are in work: 35 hours a week, 48 weeks a year.","504",NA
"Increase the funding for these free hours to cover the actual cost of nursery provision.","504",NA
"Invest £1 billion a year in Children’s Centres to support families and tackle inequalities in children’s health, development and life chances.","504",NA
"Triple the Early Years Pupil Premium (to £1,000) to give extra help to disadvantaged children who are at risk of falling behind from the very beginning of their education.","503",NA
"Require all Early Years settings to have a training programme for staff, with the majority of staff working with children to have a relevant Early Years qualification or be working towards one.","504",NA
"In the long run, each Early Years setting should have at least one person qualified to graduate level.","504",NA
"Introduce ‘baby boxes’ in England, as advocated by the Royal College of Midwives, to provide babies and parents with essential items to help with health and development.","504",NA
"Schools that Prepare Children for Life","H",NA
"An education system which focuses only on a narrow range of academic subjects and measures pupils’ abilities in a handful of high-pressure exams, does not give young people the skills they need to get on in life.","506",NA
"It also lets down those children who do not work well in exam conditions.","506",NA
"Liberal Democrats will ensure England’s education system delivers high academic standards","506",NA

"Invest to clear the backlog of repairs to school and college buildings so we have schools that are safe places to learn in.","506",NA
"End the crisis in Special Educational Needs and Disabilities funding by allocating additional cash to local authorities to halve the amount that schools pay towards the cost of a child’s Education Health and Care Plan.","506",NA
"Introduce a ‘curriculum for life’, in all state-funded schools.","506",NA
"This will include Personal, Social and Health Education, financial literacy, environmental awareness, first aid and emergency lifesaving skills, mental health education, citizenship and age-appropriate Relationships and Sex Education (RSE).","506",NA
"Teaching about sexual consent, LGBT+ relationships, and issues surrounding explicit images and content will be included in RSE.","506",NA
"Establish an independent body of education experts who will use the most up- to-date educational evidence to oversee any future curriculum changes.","506",NA
"It would take these decisions out of the hands of politicians and put an end to unnecessary and often politically motivated changes, which disrupt children’s learning and place an extra burden on teachers.","506",NA
"Reduce unnecessary stress on pupils and teachers and end ‘teaching to the test’, by scrapping existing mandatory SATs and replacing them with a formal, moderated teacher assessment at the end of each phase and some lighter- touch testing.","506",NA
"Give parents school performance measures they can trust, by replacing existing government performance tables (‘league tables’) with a broader set of indicators including information about pupils’ and teachers’ wellbeing, as well as academic attainment.","506",NA
"Replace Ofsted with a new HM Inspector of Schools. Inspections should take place every three years and should consider a broader range of factors including the social and emotional development of children, and the wellbeing of staff and pupils.","506",NA

"Teach the core skills required for children to flourish in the modern world, including critical thinking, verbal reasoning and creativity.","506",NA
"Accountable Local Schools","H",NA
"The fragmentation of the education system, with more than half of secondary schools and one quarter of primary schools in Multi-Academy Trusts (MATs), had led to a lack of accountability to local communities.","506",NA
"There is competition rather than cooperation between schools, with some operating unfair admissions systems and off-rolling pupils with Special Educational Needs and Disability or those unlikely to succeed in examinations.","506",NA
"With academies standing outside the oversight of Local Authorities, and many MAT schools not even having a local governing body, parents are finding it increasingly difficult to raise issues with schools, and there is little evidence that the children’s voice is heard.","506",NA
"There is an increasing trend to exclude children (or use internal exclusion units), which is damaging and dangerous to the young people involved.","506",NA
"The Conservatives’ ideological obsession with more grammar schools will only add further division to the system.","506",NA
"Liberal Democrats want to restore accountability and give every child the chance of attending an excellent local school.","506",NA
"We will: Give local authorities with responsibility for education the powers and resources to act as Strategic Education Authorities for their area, including responsibility for places planning, exclusions, administering admissions including in-year admissions, and SEND functions.","506",NA
"Create a level playing field by requiring MATs to undergo external inspection and allowing local authorities to open new Community Schools where needed.","506",NA

"A Better Deal for Teachers","H",NA
"There is a crisis in teacher retention and recruitment in our schools, driven by years of real-terms pay cuts, and an increasingly unmanageable workload created by unnecessary bureaucracy.","506",NA
"Teachers feel demoralised and undervalued, as the funding crisis in our schools coupled with the culture of excessive high-stakes testing prevent them from giving every child the high-quality education they deserve.","506",NA
"Liberal Democrats will ensure teachers are paid a fair wage for the vital work they do,","506",NA
"and that they are empowered to focus on delivering a high-quality education to their pupils, rather than being put under unnecessary pressure from testing and inspections which offer little-to-no educational benefit.","506",NA
"Teachers are the biggest and most important asset in our education system.","506",NA
"They need world-class levels of training and support to help them deliver the great teaching we want in our schools.","506",NA
"We will: Raise the starting salary for teachers to £30,000","506",NA
"and increase all teachers’ pay by at least three per cent per year throughout the parliament.","506",NA
"Introduce a clear and properly funded entitlement to genuinely high-quality professional development for all teachers – rising to the level of 50 hours per year by 2025.","506",NA

"Children and Families Ready to Learn","H",NA
"Education doesn’t begin and end at the school gates.","506",NA
"A love of learning can be nurtured from early childhood, and continue throughout life.","506",NA

"We also know that children cannot learn properly if they are undernourished.","504",NA
"Parents are under huge pressure and receive little support even though home is the biggest influence on children’s learning.","504",NA
"Liberal Democrats believe that parents need to be properly empowered and supported with the tools they need to raise the next generation.","504",NA
"To ensure children and adults are able to make the most of the educational opportunities which are open to them the government must also do more to support health and wellbeing.","504",NA
"We will:Extend free school meals to all children in primary education","504",NA
"and to all secondary school children whose families receive Universal Credit,","504",NA
"as well as promoting school breakfast clubs.","504",NA
"Ensure that all teaching staff have the training to identify mental health issues and that schools provide immediate access for pupil support and counselling.","506",NA

"Learning Throughout Life","H",NA
"British universities are examples of excellence throughout the world.","506",NA

"Invest an extra £1 billion in Further Education funding, including by refunding colleges for the VAT they pay.","506",NA
"Help children from poorer families to remain in education and training beyond the age of 16 by introducing a ‘Young People’s Premium’.","504",NA

"That means properly investing in the NHS and social care,","504",NA
"doing more across government to promote wellbeing and to reduce inequality at every stage of life.","503",NA
"It means making the shift from healthcare that kicks in only when people are ill to systems of wellbeing that help them to stay healthy and minimise levels of physical and mental ill-health.","504",NA
"Under the Conservatives our NHS and social care services are in a state of crisis.","504",NA
"The average wait for patients for a routine GP appointment is now more than two weeks and waiting times are rising in A&E and for operations.","504",NA
"Health inequalities are widening","504",NA
"and life expectancy stalling,","504",NA
"and we have one of the worst rates of depression in the EU.","504",NA
"The Conservatives have failed the people who rely on health and care services.","305.1",NA
"Cuts have left hospitals and community facilities crumbling and struggling with overwhelming debts, and they have damaged the services that keep us healthy.","504",NA
"Labour’s approach is no better: their plan for the NHS is a backward-looking, top- down reorganisation which would leave it in chaos.","305.1",NA
"Liberal Democrats are the only party which is forward-thinking and committed to pursuing the preventative measures that will secure the future of the NHS and Social Care.","305.1",NA
"We recognise that a well-trained and well-funded workforce lies at the heart of making sure that people can receive the care they need.","504",NA
"We cannot continue to leave our NHS and care staff undervalued, overstretched and demoralised.","504",NA
"We have a bold plan to urgently invest in the workforce and facilities and to deliver equality for mental and physical health.","504",NA
"A Liberal Democrat government will build a better health and care system.","504",NA
"Our first priorities in the next parliament will be: Raising £7 billion a year in additional revenue by putting 1p on Income Tax, with this money to be ringfenced for spending on the NHS and social care.","504",NA
"Transforming mental health by treating it with the same urgency as physical health.","504",NA
"Reforming the Health and Social Care Act as recommended by the NHS, to make the NHS work in a more efficient and joined-up way, and to end the automatic tendering of services.","504",NA
"Leaving the European Union would pose serious threats to the sustainability of the NHS and Social Care systems.","108",NA
"It would severely threaten the scope to recruit or retain staff from elsewhere in Europe (a problem which will be made worse by the Conservatives’ proposed ‘nurse tax’).","108",NA
"It risks potential delays to medicines, cancer tests, and treatments using radioisotopes.","108",NA
"If Donald Trump has his way, it means increased access by US corporations to services currently provided by the NHS and the UK drugs market.","102",NA
"Above all it means a long-term loss of financial resources as a result of reduced UK economic growth.","108",NA
"Only a Liberal Democrat government can be trusted to avoid these risks by stopping Brexit.","108",NA
"Funding for Health and Social Care","H",NA
"Health and social care services are in a state of crisis.","504",NA
"After years of underinvestment our hospitals are crumbling and there is now a staggering £6.5 billion backlog of repairs, meaning that many of our hospitals are not fit for purpose and lack money even to repair leaky roofs and replace windows.","504",NA
"The workforce feels undervalued and services are struggling to retain staff.","504",NA
"Local authorities have been starved of resources, and are using up their reserves to try and cope with the demand for social care.","504",NA
"More than a million people are unable to get the care they need.","504",NA
"Too often, people are left stranded in hospital after they finish their treatment and no longer need to be there because the follow-up care and support they need to go home is not available in the community.","504",NA
"Liberal Democrats are the only party with a long-term plan for health and care services: Labour and Conservatives make short-term promises but have no long-term vision for ensuring the sustainability of these services.","504",NA
"We know that any party seeking to lead the country at this election should be prepared to take bold action to safeguard health and social care.","504",NA
"This isn’t about doing the easiest thing, it is about doing what is right and what is essential.","504",NA
"To tackle the immediate problem, we will: Raise £7 billion a year additional revenue which will be ring-fenced to be spent only on NHS and social care services.","504",NA
"This revenue will be generated from a 1p rise on the basic, higher and additional rates of Income Tax (this revenue will be neither levied nor spent in Scotland.)","504",NA
"Use this cash to relieve the crisis in social care, tackle urgent workforce shortages,","504",NA
"and to invest in mental health and prevention services.","504",NA
"This represents the most efficient and effective way of spending these extra resources – ensuring they will have the greatest impact on the quality of care patients receive.","504",NA
"Also use £10 billion of our capital fund to make necessary investments in equipment, hospitals, community, ambulance and mental health services buildings, to bring them into the 21st century.","504",NA
"In the longer term, to put the funding of health and care on a sounder footing we will: Commission the development of a dedicated, progressive Health and Care Tax, offset by other tax reductions, on the basis of wide consultation and extensive engagement with the public","504",NA
"The intention is to bring together spending on both services into a collective budget and set out transparently, on people’s payslips, what the Government is spending on health and social care.","504",NA
"Establish a cross-party health and social care convention that builds on the existing body of work from previous conventions, select committees and the 2018 citizens’ assembly to reach agreement on the long-term sustainable funding of a joined-up system of health and social care.","504",NA
"We will invite patients’ groups, professionals, the public and the governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to be a part of this work.","504",NA
"Introducing a cap on the cost of care as provided for in the Care Act but not so far delivered by the Conservatives would be a key starting point for Liberal Democrat participants.","504",NA
"Introduce a statutory independent budget monitoring body for health and care, similar to the Office for Budget Responsibility.","504",NA
"This would report every three years on how much money the system needs to deliver safe and sustainable treatment and care, and how much is needed to meet the costs of projected increases in demand and any new initiatives – to ensure any changes in services are properly costed and affordable.","504",NA
"Our ultimate objective will be to bring together NHS, Social Care and public health seamlessly – pooling budgets in every area and supporting integrated care systems.","504",NA
"We want to see services that work in a more joined-up way for the people who depend on them","504",NA
"and with local democratic accountability and transparency.","504",NA
"Fixing Mental Health Services","H",NA
"Physical and mental health should be treated equally in the NHS.","504",NA
"In government, we fought tirelessly to bring this about and are proud of the strides forward that we made by legislating to give mental and physical health equality under the law.","504",NA
"But we know that not enough resources reach front line mental health services and that in the fight for parity of esteem, there is still a very long way to go to achieve real equality for mental health.","504",NA
"Our plan prioritises early intervention to prevent people from experiencing a mental health crisis","504",NA
"and to minimise the number and duration of in- patient stays.","504",NA
"This means ensuring all young people can access support quickly.","504",NA
"We will: Ring-fence funding from the 1p Income Tax rise to provide additional investment in mental health.","504",NA
"Introduce further mental health maximum waiting time standards, starting with children’s services,","504",NA
"services for people with eating disorders,","504",NA

"Increase access to a broader range and number of clinically effective talking therapies so that hundreds of thousands more people can receive this support,","504",NA
"with equal access for older people, BAME and LGBT+ patients, and people with autism or learning disabilities.","504",NA
"Make prescriptions for people with chronic mental health conditions available for free on the NHS,","504",NA
"as part of our commitment to review the entire schedule of exemptions for prescription charges, which has not been fully updated since 1968 and contains many anomalies.","504",NA
"Transform perinatal mental health support for those who are pregnant, new mothers and those who have experienced miscarriage or stillbirth, and help them get early care when needed.","504",NA
"Ensure every new mother gets a dedicated maternal postnatal appointment as well as introducing other measures to tackle under-diagnosis of maternal physical and mental health problems.","504",NA

"We want to build a police force that is fit for the 21st century, in which police officers feel valued and able to focus on cutting crime.","605.1",NA

"Support for Pensioners","H",NA
"Everybody should have enough to live on when they retire, but low wages and underemployment mean that people are not able to save as much for their retirement as they need.","504",NA
"Because people are living longer – meaning that their pensions need to last for 20, 30 or even 40 years – many people find themselves in an even more vulnerable position.","504",NA
"Liberal Democrats are looking to the future and will build a country that is the best place in the world to save for, and enjoy, retirement.","504",NA

"We need to build 300,000 homes per year just to meet current demand, but are barely building half that amount.","504",NA
"The Conservatives, looking back to the 1980s, have tried to solve the problem of unaffordable homes by extending Right to Buy, but that has only served to deplete stock and deepen the crisis in social housing.","504",NA

"Power for Communities","H",NA
"Communities should be empowered to have maximum control over their local services.","301",NA

"Support policies and initiatives that promote sharing over separation and counter the cost of division.","301",NA
"Help to grow the economy in Northern Ireland,","410",NA
"boost infrastructure","411",NA
"and support local businesses.","402",NA
"Funding Devolution","H",NA
"The nations of the United Kingdom have long had different needs with regard to funding.","301",NA
"The Liberal Democrats when in government delivered a substantial extension of financial powers to the nations of the UK and we will devolve further fiscal powers.","301",NA
"To ensure reliable funding, we will retain the Barnett formula to adjust spending allocations across the UK.","301",NA
"This will protect the individual nations’ budgets from external shocks.","301",NA
"However, we recognise the findings of the Holtham Commission that the current formula underfunds Wales and will commission work to update this analysis.","503",NA
"We will address the imbalance by immediately ensuring that the Barnett floor is set at a level that reflects the need for Wales to be funded fairly","503",NA
"and seek over a parliament to increase the Welsh block grant to an equitable level.","503",NA
"Englan","H",NA
"Devolution of power to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland has implications for the UK parliament and its dual role in legislating for England as well as the federal UK.","301",NA
"Liberal Democrats support an English-only stage in legislation affecting England, so that English MPs can have a separate say on laws that only affect England.","301",NA
"However, this should be on a proportional basis, genuinely reflecting the balance of opinion in England","301",NA
"In some areas of England there is a greater appetite for powers, but not every part of the country wants to move at the same speed and there cannot be a one-size fits-all approach.","301",NA
"All areas should however have access to the same opportunities and mayoral authorities should not be ranked higher in terms of the powers with which they can be granted.","301",NA
"We will enact permissive legislation to empower groups of authorities to come together to establish devolved governance – for example to a Cornish Assembly or a Yorkshire Parliament, building on the One Yorkshire campaign.","301",NA
"We will proceed by consensus as far as possible but will not allow one local authority to veto a coherent proposal.","301",NA
"Our Plan for a Better World","H",NA
"The world today feels increasingly unstable and unsafe.","107",NA
"Nationalism and authoritarianism are on the rise in countries across the globe.","107",NA
"President Trump has repeatedly acted to cause instability, whether by initiating trade wars or abandoning Kurdish allies in Syria;","102",NA
"Putin’s Russia is persistently threatening the international rules-based order;","103.1",NA
"and tensions continue to rise across the world – a brutal war still rages in Yemen,","105",NA
"relationships with Iran are increasingly difficult and citizens are protesting against their leaders in places such as Hong Kong, Pakistan and Chile.","107",NA
"The UK should be playing a leading role as part of a coalition of liberal democracies to respond to these challenges,","107",NA
"but Brexit has already undermined our ability to shape world events.","108",NA
"Both the Conservatives and Labour would pursue a mistaken and backwards-looking approach to foreign affairs that would further undermine the UK’s position in the world.","107",NA
"The Conservatives base their plans on an invented past, blind to the realities of Empire//,","305.1",NA
"and Boris Johnson has shown, with his comments about Nazanin Zaghari- Radcliffe, that he cannot be trusted to protect British citizens;","305.1",NA
"the Labour leadership, wedded to an anti-Western obsession that makes them persistent apologists for an increasingly aggressive Russian government, likewise cannot be trusted to protect the UK’s interests.","305.1",NA
"Only the Liberal Democrats have a plan to renew international liberalism in Britain and ensure that the UK plays an active role in building a better world.","107",NA
"A plan that will tear down walls, not build them;","107",NA
"a plan that will champion the values of human rights,","201.2",NA
"democracy,","202.1",NA
"and equality;","503",NA
"a plan that means working through multilateral organisations such as the EU, UN, NATO, and the WTO, rather than undermining or leaving them entirely.","107",NA
"By clearly committing to these multilateral organisations, we can tackle our shared challenges, live up to our values internationally and shape international events in the interests of the UK.","107",NA
"Our priorities in the next parliament will be: Defending international cooperation against the rising tides of nationalism and isolationism, supporting multilateral organisations like the UN and NATO which are increasingly under threat.","107",NA
"Spending 0.7 per cent of Gross National Income on aid:","107",NA
"reducing poverty,","503",NA
"defending human rights,","201.2",NA
"protecting the environment","501",NA
"and preventing violent conflict worldwide.","106",NA
"Cooperating with the UK’s European and global partners in tackling the climate and environmental emergencies.","501",NA

"A Peaceful World","H",NA
"Liberalism and cooperation have a vital role to play in securing peace,","106",NA
"promoting democracy","202.1",NA
"and defending human rights across the world.","201.2",NA
"But the rules-based international order that has governed international relations for the past 70 years is under threat.","107",NA
"The Liberal Democrats are the only party that is looking forward: neither the Conservatives nor Labour have a convincing vision of the UK’s role in the world.","305.1",NA
"We will build on the UK’s proud record of international leadership through the EU, UN, NATO and the Commonwealth by promoting values of freedom and opportunity for all.","201.1",NA
"It has never been more important for the UK to work with allies as a champion of this message.","107",NA
"We will: Champion the liberal, rules-based international order, which provides a strong basis for multilateral action to address the world’s biggest problems.","107",NA
"Use all aspects of government policy – trade, aid and diplomacy","106",NA
"as well as military cooperation –","104",NA
"to strengthen UK efforts to prevent violent conflict.","106",NA
"Increase overseas financial support for the ongoing refugee crisis, focussing on countries that have accepted millions of refugees.","107",NA
"Work with European partners to introduce a European Magnitsky Act that would enable sanctions against corrupt individuals and perpetrators of human rights abuses.","201.2",NA
"Improve control of arms exports, including by introducing a policy of ‘presumption of denial’ for arms exports to countries listed as Human Rights Priority Countries in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office’s annual human rights report.","201.2",NA
"Liberal Democrats believe that despite efforts to prevent violent conflict, sometimes military intervention is necessary.","104",NA
"The UK should only intervene militarily when there is a clear legal or humanitarian case, endorsed by a vote in parliament","202.1",NA
"– working through international institutions whenever possible.","107",NA
"We will encourage dialogue and mediation to reduce conflict between and within countries, working through the UN and other agencies.","106",NA
"In response to current crises, we will: Legislate to ensure there is a parliamentary vote before engaging in military action,","202.1",NA
"while preserving the ability to engage in action in emergencies or under treaty obligation without requiring parliamentary approval.","104",NA
"Focus on the diplomatic priorities of the UN’s Responsibility to Protect doctrine","107",NA
"and establish new tests to ensure that any UK action has regional support,","107",NA
"a reasonable prospect of defined success,","107",NA
"and a sound legal and humanitarian case.","201.2",NA
"Work with international partners to tackle violent extremism, paying special attention to UK citizens who have fought overseas for terrorist organisations who may become significant sources of terrorist activity if they return to Britain.","107",NA

"Honour our legal and moral duty to the people of Hong Kong by reopening the British National Overseas Passport offer, extending the scheme to provide the right to abode to all holders.","201.2",NA
"A Secure Defence in the 21st Century","H",NA
"The Armed Forces play a vital role in the defence of the nation: government should have a deep sense of duty to properly support service personnel and veterans.","104",NA
"Neither the Conservatives nor Labour have shown a commitment to this:","104",NA
"the Conservative government in particular has spread chronic low morale, misspent money on vanity projects and failed to recruit and retain people with the skills needed for 21st century warfare.","104",NA
"Liberal Democrats are the only party who understand the new challenges faced by the Armed Forces and who are committed to properly supporting them.","104",NA
"We will: Commit to the principle of collective self-defence as laid out in the North Atlantic Treaty and spending two per cent of GDP on defence in line with NATO recommendations:","104",NA
"as the economy grows after we have stopped Brexit, this will mean an extra £3 billion over the parliament.","104",NA
"Strengthen our armed services and address critical skills shortages by recruiting STEM graduates to be armed forces engineers, providing ‘golden handshakes’ of up to £10,000.","104",NA

"Recognise the expansion of warfare into the cybersphere by investing in our security and intelligence services and acting to counter cyberattacks.","104",NA

"while pursuing multilateral nuclear disarmament:","106",NA

"Support the Armed Forces Covenant and ongoing work to support veterans’ mental health.","504",NA
"Improve the quality of housing for service personnel by bringing the Ministry of Defence into line with other landlords, giving tenants the same legal rights to repair and maintenance as private tenants.","504",NA
"Trade, Aid and Investment","H",NA
"The liberal, international rules-based order has created peace and prosperity: trade has helped millions out of poverty and to live longer, healthier lives.","107",NA
"But the system is imperfect and must improve to tackle global inequalities: gender inequality remains widespread","503",NA
"and the climate crisis will disproportionately impact the poorest people and poorest countries.","503",NA
"Liberal Democrats are the only party with a vision for the future based on championing liberalism:","201.1",NA
"the Conservatives are inward-looking and nationalist and committed to leaving the EU, the biggest champion of the liberal order in our part of the world;","108",NA
"Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour spring to the defence of authoritarian regimes in Venezuela and Iran,","201.1",NA
"while failing to fight to stop Brexit.","108",NA
"Our plan for the future is built on championing liberal and international values,","201.1",NA
"ending poverty","503",NA
"and promoting the UN Sustainable Development Goals both in the UK and abroad.","416.2",NA

"Protect, defend, and promote human rights for all, including LGBT+ individuals who are persecuted across the world as well as those persecuted for their religion or belief.","201.2",NA
"Develop a global education strategy to address the urgent crisis of 263 million children missing out on schooling.","201.2",NA
"Work through international bodies for better regulation and scrutiny of international trade and investment treaties to ensure they do not worsen inequalities","503",NA

"Promoting Human Rights and Equality Around the World","H",NA
"Human rights are global.","201.2",NA
"An individual’s liberty should be equally respected wherever they live.","201.1",NA
"However, as authoritarian regimes trample over freedom of speech and belief and LGBT+ and other people are continuing to suffer discrimination, this is far from being the case.","201.2",NA
"Liberal Democrats are the only party capable of renewing international liberalism and combatting discrimination:","305.1",NA
"the Conservatives’ Brexit will mean prioritising trade deals over people’s rights","201.2",NA
"and Labour cannot hope to tackle discrimination abroad when they cannot even root out anti-Semitism in their own party.","305.1",NA
"We are the only party with a credible plan to enhance the UK’s soft power and to use it to promote human rights","201.2",NA
"and democracy around the world.","202.1",NA

"Global Climate Action Now","H",NA
"The climate emergency is a global challenge and requires a global solution.","501",NA
"However, with the US withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and with most national climate policies falling well short of the Agreement’s ambition to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5°C, this global solution looks a long way off.","501",NA
"Neither the Conservatives nor Labour have a plan to tackle this: the Conservatives have given no real thought to the climate emergency, and Labour are only interested in repeating empty slogans.","501",NA
"Liberal Democrats are the only party with a detailed plan to lead global efforts to combat the climate emergency.","501",NA
"We will: Support the Paris Agreement by playing a leadership role in international efforts to combat climate change,","501",NA
"demonstrating commitment by rapidly reducing emissions from the UK economy,","501",NA

"and continuing to take part in the EU’s Internal Energy Market, to provide access to clean energy sources while keeping costs low.","501",NA
"Strengthen climate and environmental goals in EU trade and investment agreements","501",NA
