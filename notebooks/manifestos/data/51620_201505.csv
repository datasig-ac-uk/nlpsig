"We have a plan for every stage of your life:",NA,NA
"FOR THE BEST START IN LIFE we will continue to increase spending on the NHS,","504",NA
"provide 7-day a week access to your GP and deliver a truly 7-day NHS – so you know you will always have access to a free and high quality health service when you need it most.","504",NA
"FOR YOUR SCHOOL YEARS we will maintain the amount of money that follows each child into school,","506",NA
"ensure there is a good primary school place available for every child","506",NA
"and lift the cap on university places – so you have the skills you need to succeed.","506",NA
"TO SECURE YOUR FIRST JOB we will create 3 million new apprenticeships;","411",NA
"take everyone earning less than £12,500 out of Income Tax altogether","404",NA
"and pass a law to ensure we have a Tax-Free Minimum Wage in this country;","412",NA
"and continue to create a fairer welfare system where benefits are capped to the level that makes work pay – so you are rewarded for working hard and doing the right thing.","505",NA
"AS YOU RAISE YOUR FAMILY we will extend the Right to Buy to Housing Association tenants,","403",NA
"build 200,000 new Starter Homes – 20 per cent below the market price, for first-time buyers under 40 //–","403",NA
"and provide 30 hours of free childcare to working parents of three and four year-olds// –","504",NA
"so you are able to work while having the security of your own home in which to raise your family.","503",NA
"WHILE YOU GROW OLDER we will not raise VAT, National Insurance contributions or Income Tax but we will raise the 40p Income Tax threshold to £50,000","503",NA
"and take the family home out of tax by increasing the effective Inheritance Tax threshold for married couples and civil partners to £1 million – so you can keep more of your income and pass it on to future generations.","503",NA
"AND WHEN YOU RETIRE we will continue to increase the Basic State Pension by at least 2.5 per cent through the triple lock,","504",NA
"give you the freedom to use your pension savings as you want and pass them on tax-free","504",NA
"and we will cap the amount you can be charged for your residential care – so you can have the dignity and security you deserve in your old age.","504",NA
"The next Conservative Government will secure a better future for you, your family and Britain.",NA,NA
"Foreword Over the last five years, we have put our country back on the right track. Five years ago, Britain was on the brink. As the outgoing Labour Treasury Minister put it with brutal candour, ‘there is no money’. Since then, we have turned things around. Britain is now one of the fastest growing major economies in the world. We are getting our national finances back under control. We have halved our deficit as a share of our economy. More people are in work than ever before. Britain is back on its feet, strong and growing stronger every day. This has not happened by accident. It is the result of difficult decisions and of patiently working through our long-term economic plan. Above all, it is the product of a supreme national effort, in which everyone has made sacrifices and everyone has played their part. It is a profound Conservative belief that our country is made great not through the action of government alone, but through the flair, the ingenuity and hard work of the British people – and so it has proved the last five years. We can be proud of what we have achieved so far together, and especially proud that as we have taken hard decisions on public spending, we have protected the National Health Service, with 9,500 more doctors and 6,900 more nurses, and ensured generous rises in the State Pension. Our friends and competitors overseas look at Britain, and they see a country that is putting its own house in order, a country on the rise. They see a country that believes in itself. But our national recovery remains a work in progress. It is fragile, and with the wrong decisions, it could easily be reversed. So the central questions at this election are these: how do we maintain our economic recovery, upon which our ambitions for our country depend? And how do we make sure that the recovery benefits every one of our citizens, at every stage of their lives? This Manifesto sets out our plan to do just that. It is a plan for a better future – for you, for your family. It is a plan for every stage of your life. For your new-born baby, there will be the world's best medical care. For your child, there will be a place at an excellent school. As you look for your first job, we are building a healthy economy that provides a good career for you with a decent income. As you look for that first home, we will make sure the Government is there to help. As you raise your family, we will help you with childcare. And as you grow older, we will ensure that you have dignity in retirement. Throughout, we will make sure that if you or your family fall ill, you will always be able to depend on our cherished National Health Service to give you the care you need. And in an increasingly dangerous and uncertain world, we will fulfil the most basic duty of government – to defend our country and keep it safe. But all of these things depend on a strong and growing economy. So as you consider how to vote, I hope you will ask this: which party is best placed to keep our economy strong? The team which has delivered the growing economy we have today, which created more jobs since 2010 than the rest of the European Union put together; or the party which left behind a ruined economy just five short years ago? Now is a time to build on the progress we have made, not to put it all at risk. This Manifesto is our plan of action – our plan to take our amazing country forward. Above all, it is a plan for you. I hope you will give it your support, so that together, we can see through the task we have begun.",NA,NA
"A strong economy to help you and your family",NA,NA
"Our commitment to you:",NA,NA
"Your job, your home, the mortgage you pay, the school your children go to, your local hospital, your pension – all these things depend on a strong economy.","408",NA
"So we will carry on working through our long-term economic plan.","404",NA
"We will:keep our economy secure by running a surplus so that we start paying down our debts","414",NA
"increase the tax-free Personal Allowance to £12,500","503",NA
"and the 40p Income Tax threshold to £50,000","503",NA
"commit to no increases in VAT, National Insurance contributions or Income Tax","503",NA
"crack down on tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance and ensure those who can afford to pay the most do","403",NA
"rebalance our economy,","414",NA
"build a Northern Powerhouse","410",NA
"and back elected metro mayors","301",NA
"pursue our ambition to become the most prosperous major economy in the world by the 2030s.","404",NA
"Our long-term economic plan is turning around Britain’s economy.","404",NA
"Five years ago, Britain was reeling from the chaos of Labour’s Great Recession;","404",NA
"in 2014 we were the fastest growing of all the major advanced economies","404",NA
"– last year, we grew 75 per cent faster than Germany, three times faster than the Eurozone and seven times faster than France.","404",NA
"Five years ago, the budget deficit was more than 10 per cent of GDP, the highest in our peacetime history, and the national debt was rising out of control;","414",NA
"today, the deficit is half that level","414",NA
"and debt as a share of national income will start falling this financial year.","414",NA
"The fastest growing of all the major advanced economies in 2014",NA,NA
"Industries are coming back to life.","410",NA
"Companies are striding into new markets.","410",NA
"Manufacturers are returning to our shores.","410",NA
"More tech companies are starting up here than anywhere else in Europe.","410",NA
"We have overtaken France as the third largest car producer in Europe","410",NA
"and there are 760,000 more businesses than in 2010 providing jobs and creating wealth across the country.","410",NA
"The Great Recession has given way to a Great Revival,","410",NA
"which is creating on average 1,000 new jobs every day:","701",NA
"more than the rest of the European Union combined.","410",NA
"This is no accident.","404",NA
"It is the product of hard work by people in every part of the country and it is thanks to the success of our long-term economic plan.","404",NA
"By halving the deficit, we have helped to restore confidence to the economy.","414",NA
"By maintaining fiscal discipline, we have helped keep mortgage rates lower than they otherwise would be.","414",NA
"And by establishing the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), we have ended – permanently – the ability of politicians to cook the books for political gain at the nation’s expense.","304",NA
"With inflation at a record low,","404",NA
"the latest OBR forecasts show that living standards will be higher in 2015 than in 2010,","404",NA
"and are set to grow strongly every year for the rest of the decade, with the average family £900 better off.","404",NA
"It is only by securing the recovery,","414",NA
"dealing with our debts","414",NA
"and creating jobs","701",NA
"that we can continue to raise living standards.","503",NA
"That means sticking to our long-term economic plan; Britain is on the right path.","404",NA
"But the job is not finished.","404",NA
"There are clouds on the international horizon.","404",NA
"Huge challenges remain at home.","414",NA
"We have cut the record deficit we inherited to five per cent of GDP, but that is still too high.","414",NA
"Our trade with emerging economies is up, with exports to China more than doubled since 2009,","410",NA
"but overall we are still too dependent on slow-growing European markets.","410",NA
"Business investment is rising, but we still underinvest compared to other countries.","410",NA
"Productivity remains too low.","410",NA
"And while prosperity is now spreading around the country, our economic growth remains uneven, too reliant on financial services.","410",NA
"1,000 jobs created for every day of the Parliament since 2010",NA,NA
"We will finish the job we started in a balanced way.","414",NA
"Those with the broadest shoulders have contributed the most to deficit reduction","414",NA
"– which is why inequality has fallen,","503",NA
"and child and pensioner poverty are down – and they will continue to do so.","503",NA
"We will increase NHS spending every year.","504",NA
"We will control spending,","414",NA
"eliminate the deficit,","414",NA
"and start to run a surplus.","414",NA
"We will go from stuck in the red, to back in the black.","414",NA
"By building on the foundations we have put in place, we will have a truly national recovery and be able to pursue our ambition for Britain to become the most prosperous major economy in the world by the 2030s.","410",NA
"If we do not stick to our long-term economic plan, we will slip back again, reversing the progress we have made in the last five years.","404",NA
"More borrowing – and the extra debt interest that it brings – means there is less money to spend on schools and hospitals.","414",NA
"More spending means higher taxes for hardworking people,","414",NA
"and interest rates that are higher than they otherwise would be – punishing homeowners, hurting businesses, costing jobs.","414",NA
"A strong economy allows us to invest in and protect our public services like the NHS and schools",NA,NA
"And failing to control our debt would be more than an economic failing; it would be a moral failing – leaving our children and grandchildren with debts that they could never hope to repay.","414",NA
"So you face a clear choice.","404",NA
"Economic competence, with David Cameron as Prime Minister, following through on our long-term economic plan.","404",NA
"Or economic chaos under Labour, with higher taxes, more debt and no plan to fix our public finances, create jobs or build a more secure economy.","404",NA
"Our plan of action:",NA,NA
"We will finish the job by eliminating the deficit to keep our economy secure and keep your taxes and mortgage payments down","414",NA
"Our long-term economic plan reflects our values:","404",NA
"we as a nation should not be piling up and passing on unaffordable levels of debt to the next generation.","414",NA
"We will eliminate the deficit in a sensible and balanced way","414",NA
"that will enable us to continue to increase spending on the NHS","504",NA
"and cut Income Tax for 30 million working people.","701",NA
"Our deficit reduction plan has two phases.","414",NA
"The first will see us continue to reduce government spending by one per cent each year in real terms for the first two full financial years of the next Parliament, the same rate as over the last five years.","414",NA
"That means saving £1 a year in every £100 that government spends.","414",NA
"We don’t think there’s a business that couldn’t do that – and we don’t think government, when it is spending your money, should be any different.","414",NA
"We have halved the deficit as a share of our economy",NA,NA
"That will require a further £30 billion in fiscal consolidation over the next two years,","414",NA
"on top of the £120 billion that we have already identified and delivered over this Parliament.","414",NA
"We will find £13 billion from departmental savings, the same rate of reduction as in this Parliament.","414",NA
"We will find £12 billion from welfare savings,","505",NA
"on top of the £21 billion of savings delivered in this Parliament.","414",NA
"And we will raise at least £5 billion from continuing to tackle tax evasion, and aggressive tax avoidance and tax planning,","414",NA
"building on the £7 billion of annual savings we have delivered in this Parliament.","414",NA
"This £30 billion of further consolidation is necessary to ensure that debt keeps falling as a share of GDP and to deliver a balanced structural current budget in 2017-18, meeting the new fiscal mandate that Parliament voted on earlier this year.","414",NA
"Our commitment goes further than this.","414",NA
"A balanced current budget is not enough to deliver a reliable reduction in our level of national debt, which remains far too high in a world of continuing economic challenges.","414",NA
"International evidence and Treasury analysis shows that the only way to keep our economy secure for the future is to eliminate the deficit entirely and start running a surplus.","414",NA
"Anything less would be to ignore the lessons of the past.","414",NA
"That is why, in the second phase of our deficit reduction plan starting in 2018-19, we are set to move into surplus, with the Government taking in more than it is spending for the first time in 18 years.","414",NA
"That means we can start properly paying down our debts and reducing the scale of annual interest payments – reducing the UK’s vulnerability to future shocks by fixing the roof while the sun is shining.","414",NA
"We will achieve this by continuing to control government spending in 2018-19, no longer cutting it in real terms, but instead growing it in line with inflation.","414",NA
"To eliminate the deficit we must continue to cut out wasteful spending and make government more efficient, effective and accountable",NA,NA
"From 2019-20, after a surplus has been achieved, spending will grow in line with GDP.","414",NA
"A new fundamental principle of fiscal policy, monitored by the independent OBR, will ensure that in normal economic times, when the economy is growing, the government will always run a surplus in order to reduce our national debt and keep our economy secure,","414",NA
"with a state neither smaller than we need nor bigger than we can afford.","404",NA
"Total government spending as a share of our national income at the end of the next Parliament is forecast to be very slightly higher than in the year 2000, the year before Labour lost all control of spending and the national debt started its longest rise for hundreds of years.","414",NA
"Our approach is focused on reducing wasteful spending, making savings in welfare,","505",NA
"and continuing to crack down on tax evasion and aggressive avoidance.","403",NA
"This means that we can commit to no increases in VAT, Income Tax or National Insurance.","404",NA
"Tax rises on working people would harm our economy, reduce living standards and cost jobs.","404",NA
"Instead, as we reduce the deficit,","414",NA
"we will cut Income Tax, as we have done over the last five years:","404",NA
"during the next Parliament, we will increase the tax-free Personal Allowance to £12,500","404",NA
"and the higher rate threshold to £50,000, so you keep more of your hard-earned money.","404",NA
"The richest are paying a greater share of income tax than in any of Labour’s 13 years",NA,NA
"We will continue to build a stronger, safer and more secure banking system that serves its customers and provides businesses with the finance they need to grow","414",NA
"and create jobs","701",NA
"We will make sure our financial services industry is the best regulated in the world with our new system of supervision led by the independent Bank of England.","414",NA
"Our new Financial Policy Committee will monitor and control the growth of indebtedness and imbalances across the whole economy– a vital task that was totally ignored in the run up to the financial crisis.","414",NA
"Our tough new Financial Conduct Authority will protect consumers and ensure that financial markets work for the benefit of the whole economy.","403",NA
"To protect hardworking taxpayers from future banking crashes, we will finish the process of ring-fencing banks’ high street branches from their investment arms by 2019 at the latest.","403",NA
"In order to ensure that new pay structures for bankers rebuild trust and reduce short-termism, we will ensure that Britain continues to have the toughest regime of bonus deferral and clawback of any financial centre.","403",NA
"We will continue to sell the Government’s stakes in the bailed-out banks and building societies in order to deliver value for money for taxpayers and support the economy.","401",NA
"Hardworking taxpayers supported the banks during the financial crisis and so the banks should in turn support them during the recovery – that is why we will keep the bank levy in place and restrict established banks’ ability to pay less tax by offsetting their profits against past losses.","403",NA
"We will make the banks work for you",NA,NA
"Our plan is to ensure banks help secure our recovery and back businesses to create jobs and growth in our economy.","414",NA
"We capped payday lenders, made it easier for you to switch your bank account and will continue to support the credit union movement in making financial services more accessible.","403",NA
"We will continue the successful Funding for Lending scheme into 2016.","403",NA
"We will help new and existing challenger banks to inject fresh competition into the market for personal current accounts, mortgages and business loans, including through the British Business Bank,","403",NA
"while backing the financial technology revolution.","411",NA
"We will improve our support for investment into start-ups","403",NA
"and roll-out our innovative Help to Grow scheme, which will plug a £1 billion finance gap for firms that are looking to expand, invest","403",NA
"and take on new employees.","701",NA
"We will continue to lead the world on tax and transparency",NA,NA
"Tackling tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance and tax planning is an important part of our long-term economic plan.","404",NA
"We will increase the annual tax charges paid by those with non-domiciled status,","403",NA
"ensuring that they make a fair contribution to reducing the deficit, and continue to tackle abuses of this status.","414",NA
"We will lead international efforts to ensure global companies pay their fair share in tax,","403",NA
"as David Cameron did at the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland in 2013, which secured significant international progress on fairer tax rules and full transparency over who really owns companies.","403",NA
"We will push for all countries to sign up to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative;","403",NA
"review the implementation of the new international country-by-country tax reporting rules and consider the case for making this information publicly available on a multilateral basis.","403",NA
"We will ensure developing countries have full access to global automatic tax information exchange systems and continue to build the capacity of tax authorities in developing countries.","403",NA
"We are also making it a crime if companies fail to put in place measures to stop economic crime, such as tax evasion, in their organisations","605",NA
"and making sure that the penalties are large enough to punish and deter.","605",NA
"We are fixing the economy so that everyone feels the benefit",NA,NA
"We will rebalance our economy and build a Northern Powerhouse",NA,NA
"We are committed to a truly national recovery, benefiting all parts of our country.","601",NA
"We have devolved powers to Scotland and Wales,","301",NA
"and set out long-term economic plans to raise the growth rate of all parts of England, bringing areas which have grown more slowly up to at least the national average.","404",NA
"Over the last year, the North grew faster than the South.","410",NA
"By connecting up the North with modern transport links, we will enable its great cities and towns to pool their strengths.","410",NA
"We will invest a record £13 billion in transport for the North.","411",NA
"We will electrify the main rail routes, build the Northern Hub, and provide new trains for the North.","411",NA
"We will upgrade the A1, M62, M1 and A555 link road.","411",NA
"And that is on top of our £50 billion commitment to build High Speed 2 – the new North-South railway linking up London with the West Midlands, Leeds and Manchester","411",NA
"– and develop High Speed 3 to join up the North.","411",NA
"We will back scientific and technical strengths by creating new institutions such as Health North;","411",NA
"the Royce Institute for Advanced Materials in Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool and Sheffield;","411",NA
"the National Centre for Ageing Science and Innovation in Newcastle;","411",NA
"the Cognitive Computing centre at Daresbury;","411",NA
"and by making investments in energy research in Blackpool, Cumbria and Thornton.","411",NA
"We will back new jobs in the South West",NA,NA
"To help attract growth and new businesses we will improve connections to the South West with major investment in the M5, A358, A30 and A303,","411",NA
"and the electrification of the Great Western Main Line – bringing new fast trains on the route.","411",NA
"We will invest to boost tourism in the South West","404",NA
"and ensure the world-class defence assets and cyber-security industries of the South West benefit the local economy.","404",NA
"Britain's exports are growing fastest in the North East and our employment fastest in the North West",NA,NA
"We will make the Midlands an engine of growth",NA,NA
"We will back business by investing a record £5.2 billion in better transport,","411",NA
"upgrading the M1 and M6,","411",NA
"and electrifying the Midland Main Line from St Pancras to Sheffield","411",NA
"–putting the Midlands at the centre of a modern, inter-connected transport network for the UK.","411",NA
"We will back the Midlands’ strength in advanced manufacturing, engineering and science with major projects such as the Energy Research Accelerator","411",NA
"and support for innovation in the motor industry.","411",NA
"We will properly connect the East of England and back innovation",NA,NA
"We will improve rail connections to East Anglia, delivering ‘Norwich in 90 minutes’ and ‘Ipswich in 60 minutes’","411",NA
"and upgrade key roads like the A11 and A47.","411",NA
"We will support the creation of new jobs","701",NA
"by backing the East’s great strengths – agri-tech, high-tech businesses around Cambridge,","411",NA
"and energy businesses at Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft.","411",NA
"We support policies that grow the economy as a whole, generating new jobs and higher wages for everybody",NA,NA
"We will devolve powers and budgets to boost local growth in England",NA,NA
"We will devolve far-reaching powers over economic development, transport and social care to large cities which choose to have elected mayors.","301",NA
"We will legislate to deliver the historic deal for Greater Manchester, which will devolve powers and budgets and lead to the creation of a directly elected Mayor for Greater Manchester.","301",NA
"In Cambridgeshire, Greater Manchester and Cheshire East, we will pilot allowing local councils to retain 100 per cent of growth in business rates, so they reap the benefit of decisions that boost growth locally.","301",NA
"We will devolve further powers over skills spending and planning to the Mayor of London.","301",NA
"And we will deliver more bespoke Growth Deals with local councils, where locally supported,","301",NA
"and back Local Enterprise Partnerships to promote jobs and growth.","301",NA
"Better roads, trains and modern communications",NA,NA
"Our commitment to you:",NA,NA
"You depend on infrastructure at every stage of your life:","411",NA
"to go to school, to go to work, to enable businesses to grow and create jobs for your children and grandchildren.","411",NA
"We have a plan of action that will improve our roads, railways, airports and internet connections. We will:","411",NA
"invest in infrastructure to attract businesses and good jobs across the whole of the UK","411",NA
"make your life easier, with more and faster trains, more roads and cycle routes","411",NA
"keep commuter rail fares frozen in real terms for the whole of the next Parliament","412",NA
"roll out universal broadband and better mobile phone connections, to ensure everyone is part of the digital economy.","411",NA
"Under Labour, road and rail were starved of resources,","411",NA
"while too many people were stuck on the wrong side of the digital divide.","411",NA
"This meant packed trains, potholes, patchy broadband coverage – businesses held back and cities left behind.","411",NA
"Turning these problems around takes time.","411",NA
"Improving our trains, roads and broadband",NA,NA
"helps local businesses grow",NA,NA
"and create more jobs and opportunities",NA,NA
"But because we have made savings elsewhere, we have been able to make significant investments in infrastructure.","411",NA
"We will commit, alongside running a surplus, to increase our capital spending – investment in infrastructure – at least in line with our national income.","411",NA
"We have set out a plan to invest over £100 billion in our infrastructure over the next Parliament.","411",NA
"This will fund the biggest investment in rail since Victorian times,","411",NA
"and the most extensive improvements to our roads since the 1970s.","411",NA
"And it will give us the most comprehensive and cheapest superfast broadband coverage of any major European country.","411",NA
"We are investing over £2 billion electrifying our railways",NA,NA
"Our plan of action:",NA,NA
"We will spend more on infrastructure, to improve your quality of life",NA,NA
"Overall public investment will be higher on average over this decade, as a percentage of GDP, than under the whole period of the last Labour Government.","411",NA
"We will deliver on our National Infrastructure Plan and respond to the Airports Commission’s final report.","411",NA
"We will transform our railway network",NA,NA
"We will invest £38 billion in our railway network in the five years to 2019.","411",NA
"Electrification of the railways is a key part of our investment programme, with work already underway across the North, the Midlands, and South Wales;","411",NA
"there are plans to go further in the rest of the country, including East Anglia and the South West.","411",NA
"In addition to rolling out our national high-speed rail network, with High Speed 2 and High Speed 3,","411",NA
"we will complete the construction of the new east-west Crossrail across Greater London,","411",NA
"and push forward with plans for Crossrail 2, a new rail route running through London and connecting Surrey and Hertfordshire.","411",NA
"We will support a fairer deal for taxpayers and commuters:","403",NA
"we will keep commuter rail fares frozen in real terms for the whole of the next Parliament","412",NA
"– regulated fares will only be able to rise by Retail Price Inflation, and train operating companies will not have any flexibility to raise ticket prices above this.","412",NA
"We will also introduce smart ticketing and part-time season tickets and require train companies to improve compensation arrangements for passengers when trains are more than a few minutes late.","403",NA
"We are investing millions of pounds in fitting out trains with new wi-fi equipment and improving mobile phone signals, which will benefit passengers on trains across England and Wales.","411",NA

"We will invest £15 billion in roads.","411",NA
"This will include over £6 billion in the northern road network, with the dualling and widening of the A1 north of Newcastle and the first new trans-Pennine road capacity in over 40 years.","411",NA
"We will take action to tackle some of the most notorious and longstanding problems on our road network, including improvements to the A303, A47 and A27.","411",NA
"We will add 1,300 extra lane miles to our roads,","411",NA
"improve over 60 problem junctions,","411",NA

"We will secure the delivery of superfast broadband in urban and rural areas to provide coverage to 95 per cent of the UK by the end of 2017,","411",NA

"Jobcentre Plus advisers will work with schools and colleges to supplement careers advice and provide routes into work experience and apprenticeships.","404",NA
"But it is not fair – on taxpayers, or on young people themselves – that 18-21 year-olds with no work experience should slip straight into a life on benefits without first contributing to their community.","505",NA
"So we will introduce tougher Day One Work Requirements for young people claiming out-of-work benefits.","505",NA
"We will replace the Jobseeker’s Allowance for 18-21 year-olds with a Youth Allowance that will be time-limited to six months, after which young people will have to take an apprenticeship, a traineeship or do daily community work for their benefits.","505",NA

"We will, in addition, tackle the disproportionate impact of strikes in essential public services by introducing a tougher threshold in health, education, fire and transport.","702",NA

"We want to see full, genuine gender equality.","503",NA

"We ring-fenced the science budget by making difficult choices to reduce spending in other areas.","411",NA
"Now we will invest new capital on a record scale – £6.9 billion in the UK’s research infrastructure up to 2021","411",NA

"We will support our fishing and coastal communities",NA,NA

"pass a new law so that nobody working 30 hours on the Minimum Wage pays Income Tax on what they earn","404",NA
"back aspiration by raising the 40p tax threshold – so that no one earning less than £50,000 pays it","404",NA
"cap overall welfare spending,","505",NA
"lower the amount of benefits that any household can receive to £23,000","505",NA
"and continue to roll out Universal Credit, to make work pay","505",NA
"bring in tax-free childcare to support parents back into work,","504",NA
"and give working parents of 3 and 4-year-olds 30 hours of free childcare a week.","504",NA
"Under Labour, those who worked hard found more and more of their earnings taken away in tax to support a welfare system that allowed, and even encouraged, people to choose benefits when they could be earning a living.","505",NA
"This sent out terrible signals: if you did the right thing, you were penalised – and if you did the wrong thing, you were rewarded, with the unfairness of it all infuriating hardworking people.","505",NA
"We have cut Income Tax for over 26 million people",NA,NA
"– and taken over 3 million people out of Income Tax altogether",NA,NA
"Over the last five years, we have cut people’s taxes wherever possible.","404",NA
"We have raised the tax-free Personal Allowance to £10,600 from £6,475:","404",NA
"over 26 million people are now keeping more of their hard-earned money","404",NA
"and 3 million of the lowest paid are paying no Income Tax at all.","404",NA
"We believe that cutting people’s taxes is the right thing to do – not only because it is your money,","404",NA
"but also because cutting the taxes of the lowest paid and helping them stand on their own two feet is the most effective poverty-tackling measure there is.","404",NA
"Real fairness means that where people really cannot work, they must be supported – but where they are able to work, they should.","404",NA
"We have made long overdue changes to our welfare system.","505",NA
"We have capped benefits so no household can take more in out-of-work benefits than the average household earns by going out to work.","505",NA
"We have begun to introduce Universal Credit – a way to simplify benefits into a new single payment – so that work always pays.","505",NA
"We are reassessing those on incapacity benefits so that help goes to those who really need it.","505",NA
"The days of something for nothing are over","505",NA
"– and all this has helped to reduce by 900,000 the number of people living in workless households.","404",NA
"In the next Parliament, we will continue to reward hard work:","404",NA
"raising the tax-free Personal Allowance so that those working 30 hours on the Minimum Wage pay no Income Tax at all","404",NA
"and taking hardworking people out of a 40p higher rate tax band originally meant to capture only the wealthy.","404",NA
"And we will see through our welfare reforms, lowering the benefit cap and rolling out Universal Credit, to make the system fairer and reward hard work.","404",NA
"The goal of welfare reform should be to reward hard work",NA,NA
"and protect the vulnerable",NA,NA
"Our plan of action:",NA,NA
"We will reward work",NA,NA
"A Conservative Government will not increase the rates of VAT, Income Tax or National Insurance in the next Parliament.","404",NA
"Instead, we will ease the burden of taxation by raising the tax-free Personal Allowance – the amount you can earn before you start paying tax – to £12,500.","503",NA
"This will cut Income Tax for 30 million people and take everyone who earns less than £12,500 out of Income Tax altogether.","503",NA
"That means by the end of the decade, one million more people on the lowest wages will be lifted out of Income Tax,","503",NA
"and people who work for 30 hours a week on the increased National Minimum Wage will no longer pay any Income Tax at all.","503",NA
"We will pass a new law so that the Personal Allowance automatically rises in line with the National Minimum Wage.","503",NA
"The new Tax Free Minimum Wage law will be applied from the first Budget after the General Election.","503",NA
"The change will update the 1977 'Rooker-Wise' amendment which forced governments to uprate tax thresholds in line with inflation, meaning the Personal Allowance will now increase more quickly.","503",NA
"We will cut Income Tax for 30 million people – so that hard work is always rewarded",NA,NA
"We will back your ambition",NA,NA
"The 40p tax rate was only supposed to be paid by the best-off people in our country.","503",NA
"But in the past couple of decades, far too many have been dragged into it.","503",NA
"We have already announced an above-inflation increase in the threshold next year.","404",NA
"Now we will raise the 40p tax threshold much further, so that no one earning less than £50,000 pays the higher rate of Income Tax.","404",NA
"The 800,000 people earning between £42,385 and £50,000 will no longer pay the 40p rate of tax.","404",NA
"We will support you as you raise your family",NA,NA
"We will support you, whether you choose to go out to work or stay at home to raise your children.","603",NA
"We will back the institution of marriage in our society, enabling married couples to transfer £1,060 of their tax-free income to their husband or wife, where the highest earner is a basic rate taxpayer.","603",NA
"This applies to civil partnerships too, and the transferable amount will always rise at least in line with the Personal Allowance.","603",NA
"And we will help families stay together and handle the stresses of modern life by continuing to invest at least £7.5 million a year in relationship support.","603",NA
"We will bring in tax-free childcare to help parents return to work, and give working parents of three and four year-olds 30 hours of free childcare a week",NA,NA
"We have already legislated to introduce tax-free childcare in the next Parliament – worth up to £2,000 per child per year – to help parents who want to work.","504",NA
"We introduced 15 hours a week of free childcare for all three and four-year olds","504",NA
"and the most deprived two year-olds.","504",NA
"And because working families with children under school age face particularly high childcare costs, in the next Parliament we will give families where all parents are working an entitlement to 30 hours of free childcare for their three and four year-olds.","504",NA

"We will keep a check on the growth of welfare spending,","505",NA
"enabling us to provide a system that is fair to those who need it, and fair to those who pay for it too.","505",NA
"Our overall welfare cap will limit the amount that government can spend on certain social security benefits in the five years from 2015-16.","505",NA

"We will deliver Universal Credit, in order to provide the right incentives for people to work;","505",NA
"target support at those who need it most;","504",NA
"reduce fraud and error;","505",NA
"and streamline administration of the welfare system.","505",NA

"Immigration brings real benefits to Britain – to our economy, our culture and our national life.","607",NA
"We will always be a party that is open, outward-looking and welcoming to people from all around the world.","607",NA
"We also know that immigration must be controlled.","601",NA
"When immigration is out of control, it puts pressure on schools, hospitals and transport;","601",NA
"and it can cause social pressures if communities find it hard to integrate.","608",NA
"We must work to control immigration and put Britain first",NA,NA
"Between 1997 and 2009, under the last Labour Government, we had the largest influx of people Britain had ever seen.","601",NA
"Their open borders policy, combined with their failure to reform welfare, meant that for years over 90 percent of employment growth in this country was accounted for by foreign nationals","601",NA
"– even though there were 1.4 million people who spent most of the 2000s living on out-of-work benefits.","601",NA
"For the past five years, we have been working to turn around the situation we inherited.","601",NA
"Since 2010, we have stripped more than 850 bogus colleges of their rights to sponsor foreign students;","605",NA
"installed proper exit checks at our borders;","605",NA
"cracked down on illegal working and sham marriages;","605",NA
"made it harder for people to live in the UK illegally, by restricting their access to bank accounts, driving licences and private housing;","605",NA
"and reduced the number of appeal routes to stop people clogging up our courts with spurious attempts to remain in the country.","605",NA
"All of this has made a difference.","605",NA
"Immigration from outside the EU has come down since 2010.","605",NA
"Non-EU migration cut by 13 per cent – and economic migration from outside the EU capped",NA,NA
"We have seen many more people from the EU coming to Britain than originally anticipated, principally because our economy has been growing so much more rapidly and creating more jobs than other EU countries.","110",NA
"As a result, our action has not been enough to cut annual net migration to the tens of thousands.","110",NA
"That ambition remains the right one.","110",NA
"But it is clearly going to take more time, more work and more difficult long-term decisions to achieve.","110",NA
"Continuing this vital work will be our priority over the next five years.","110",NA
"We will negotiate new rules with the EU, so that people will have to be earning here for a number of years before they can claim benefits, including the tax credits that top up low wages.","110",NA
"Instead of something-for-nothing, we will build a system based on the principle of something-for-something.","110",NA
"We will then put these changes to the British people in a straight in-out referendum on our membership of the European Union by the end of 2017.","110",NA
"At the same time, we will continue to strengthen our borders, improve the enforcement of our immigration laws and act to make sure people leave at the end of their visas.","605",NA
"Across the spectrum, from the student route to the family and work routes, we will build a system that truly puts you, your family and the British people first.","601",NA
"Our plan of action:",NA,NA
"We will regain control of EU migration by reforming welfare rules",NA,NA
"Changes to welfare to cut EU migration will be an absolute requirement in the renegotiation.","110",NA
"We have already banned housing benefit for EU jobseekers,","110",NA
"and restricted other benefits, including Jobseeker's Allowance.","110",NA
"We will insist that EU migrants who want to claim tax credits and child benefit must live here and contribute to our country for a minimum of four years.","110",NA
"This will reduce the financial incentive for lower-paid, lower-skilled workers to come to Britain.","110",NA
"We will introduce a new residency requirement for social housing, so that EU migrants cannot even be considered for a council house unless they have been living in an area for at least four years.","110",NA
"If an EU migrant’s child is living abroad, then they should receive no child benefit or child tax credit, no matter how long they have worked in the UK and no matter how much tax they have paid.","110",NA
"To reduce the numbers of EU migrants coming to Britain, we will end the ability of EU jobseekers to claim any job-seeking benefits at all.","110",NA
"And if jobseekers have not found a job within six months, they will be required to leave.","110",NA
"Tougher tests for migrants before they can claim benefits",NA,NA
"We will tackle criminality and abuse of free movement",NA,NA
"We will negotiate with the EU to introduce stronger powers to deport criminals and stop them coming back,","110",NA
"and tougher and longer re-entry bans for all those who abuse free movement.","110",NA
"We want to toughen requirements for non-EU spouses to join EU citizens, including with an income threshold and English language test.","110",NA
"And when new countries are admitted to the EU in future, we will insist that free movement cannot apply to those new members until their economies have converged much more closely with existing Member States.","110",NA
"We will continue to cut immigration from outside the EU",NA,NA
"We have already capped the level of skilled economic migration from outside the EU.","406",NA
"We will maintain our cap at 20,700 during the next Parliament.","406",NA
"This will ensure that we only grant visas to those who have the skills we really need in our economy.","406",NA
"We will reform the student visa system with new measures to tackle abuse and reduce the numbers of students overstaying once their visas expire.","406",NA
"Our action will include clamping down on the number of so-called ‘satellite campuses’ opened in London by universities located elsewhere in the UK, and reviewing the highly trusted sponsor system for student visas.","406",NA
"And as the introduction of exit checks will allow us to place more responsibility on visa sponsors for migrants who overstay, we will introduce targeted sanctions for those colleges or businesses that fail to ensure that migrants comply with the terms of their visa.","605",NA
"We will strengthen the enforcement of immigration rules",NA,NA
"We have introduced a ‘deport first, appeal later’ rule for foreign national offenders.","601",NA
"We will now remove even more illegal immigrants by extending this rule to all immigration appeals and judicial reviews, including where a so-called right to family life is involved, apart from asylum claims.","601",NA
"We will also implement a new removals strategy to take away opportunities for spurious legal challenge and opportunities to abscond.","605",NA
"We will introduce satellite tracking for every foreign national offender subject to an outstanding deportation order or deportation proceedings.","605",NA
"And we will implement the requirement for all landlords to check the immigration status of their tenants.","601",NA
"We will tackle people trafficking and exploitation",NA,NA
"We have already re-introduced a proper system of exit checks across the country,","605",NA
"passed a Modern Slavery Act that will protect people from exploitation,","605",NA
"and quadrupled the fines for unscrupulous employers who undercut the Minimum Wage.","605",NA
"Now we will introduce tougher labour market regulation to tackle illegal working and exploitation.","605",NA
"To crack down further on illegal working, we will harness data from multiple agencies, including Exit Checks data, to identify illegal immigrants and businesses that employ illegal workers.","605",NA
"And to incentivise tougher action on employers who do not pay the minimum wage, we will allow inspection teams to reinvest more of the money raised by fines levied on employers.","605",NA
"We will ease pressure on public services and your local community",NA,NA
"We are taking unprecedented action to tackle health tourism and will recover up to £500 million from migrants who use the NHS by the middle of the next Parliament.","601",NA
"To help communities experiencing high and unexpected volumes of immigration, we will introduce a new Controlling Migration Fund to ease pressures on services and to pay for additional immigration enforcement.","601",NA
"To prevent sectors becoming partially or wholly reliant on foreign workers, we will require those regularly utilising the Shortage Occupation List, under which they can bring skilled foreign workers into the UK, to provide long-term plans for training British workers.","601",NA
"We will protect British values and our way of life",NA,NA
"We will promote integration and British values","608",NA
"Being able to speak English is a fundamental part of integrating into our society.","608",NA
"We have introduced tough new language tests for migrants and ensured councils reduce spending on translation services.","608",NA
"Next, we will legislate to ensure that every public sector worker operating in a customer-facing role must speak fluent English.","608",NA
"And to encourage better integration into our society, we will also require those coming to Britain on a family visa with only basic English to become more fluent over time, with new language tests for those seeking a visa extension.","608",NA

"and make sure there is no cap on university places, so we have aspiration for all.","506",NA
"We know what works in education: great teachers; brilliant leadership; rigour in the curriculum; discipline in the classroom; proper exams.","506",NA
"We have been bold in reforming the education system to deliver these things, based upon simple, clear principles and values.","506",NA
"We believe that parents and teachers should be empowered to run their schools independently.","506",NA
"We believe that teaching is a highly skilled profession, and that we need to attract the best graduates into it.","506",NA
"And we believe that there is no substitute for a rigorous academic curriculum to secure the best from every pupil.","506",NA
"We inherited a system where far too many children left school without the qualifications and skills they needed.","506",NA
"One in three children was leaving primary school unable to read, write and add up properly.","506",NA
"The number of pupils studying the core academic subjects at GCSE had halved.","506",NA
"Our schools had fallen down the global league tables for maths and science.","506",NA
"And the poorest children were attending the weakest schools.","506",NA
"Our far-reaching education reforms have changed this.","506",NA
"We have brought high standards back to teaching, discipline back to schools, and challenging subjects back onto the curriculum.","506",NA
"Today, there are a million more pupils in schools rated by Ofsted as ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’.","506",NA
"Over a thousand schools that were ranked ‘inadequate’ have become Academies, bringing in new leadership to promote discipline, rigour and higher standards.","506",NA
"There are over 250 new free schools – set up and run by local people – delivering better education for the children who need it most.","506",NA
"We have boosted the number of apprenticeships to record levels – 2.2 million over the last five years","411",NA
"– and last September more people headed off to university than at any time in history.","506",NA
"Too many children, however, are still not receiving the excellent education that they deserve.","506",NA

"There are a million more pupils in schools rated by Ofsted as ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’",NA,NA
"Our plan of action:",NA,NA
"We will drive up standards in your child’s school",NA,NA
"We have made exams more rigorous and ended grade inflation.","506",NA
"There is more to do.","506",NA
"We will start by introducing tough new standards for literacy and numeracy in primary schools.","506",NA
"We will expect every 11-year-old to know their times tables off by heart and be able to perform long division and complex multiplication.","506",NA
"They should be able to read a book and write a short story with accurate punctuation, spelling and grammar.","506",NA
"If children do not reach the required standards in their exams at the end of primary school, they will resit them at the start of secondary school, to make sure no pupil is left behind.","506",NA
"We will require secondary school pupils to take GCSEs in English, maths, science, a language and history or geography, with Ofsted unable to award its highest ratings to schools that refuse to teach these core subjects.","506",NA
"We will ensure there is a good primary school place for your child, with zero tolerance of failure",NA,NA
"We have more than doubled Labour’s spending on new school places.","506",NA
"But we want to go even further, investing at least £7 billion over the next Parliament to provide good school places.","506",NA
"And we will let our best headteachers take control of failing primary schools, by expanding the National Leaders of Education programme.","506",NA
"Every school needs high standards, proper funding and accountability",NA,NA
"We will turn every failing and coasting secondary school into an academy, and deliver free schools if parents in your area want them",NA,NA
"Over 4,000 schools are already benefiting from academy status, giving them more power over discipline and budgets.","506",NA
"And nearly 800 of the worst-performing primary schools have been taken over by experienced academy sponsors with a proven track record of success.","506",NA
"This is improving education for our children.","506",NA
"So we will continue to expand academies, free schools, studio schools and University Technical Colleges.","506",NA
"Over the next Parliament, we will open at least 500 new free schools,","506",NA
"resulting in 270,000 new school places.","506",NA
"And we will introduce new powers to force coasting schools to accept new leadership.","506",NA
"Any school judged by Ofsted to be requiring improvement will be taken over by the best headteachers – backed by expert sponsors or high-performing neighbouring schools – unless it can demonstrate that it has a plan to improve rapidly.","506",NA
"We will continue to allow all good schools to expand, whether they are maintained schools, academies, free schools or grammar schools.","506",NA
"We will continue to protect school funding",NA,NA
"Over the last five years, we have protected the schools budget and committed £18 billion for new school buildings, so that children can learn in the best environment possible.","506",NA
"Under a future Conservative Government, the amount of money following your child into school will be protected.","506",NA
"As the number of pupils increases, so will the amount of money in our schools.","506",NA
"On current pupil number forecasts, there will be a real-terms increase in the schools budget in the next Parliament.","506",NA
"We will continue to provide the pupil premium, protected at current rates, so that schools receive additional money for those from the poorest backgrounds.","506",NA
"We will support families by providing free meals to all infants.","504",NA
"And we will make schools funding fairer.","506",NA
"We have already increased funding for the 69 least well-funded local authorities in the country, and will make this the baseline for their funding in the next Parliament.","506",NA
"We will not allow state schools to make a profit.","506",NA
"We will back your child’s teachers",NA,NA
"We have already given teachers greater disciplinary powers.","506",NA
"In the next Parliament, we will expect every teacher to be trained not just in how to tackle serious behaviour issues, but also in how to deal with the low level disruption that stops children from learning properly.","506",NA
"This generation of teachers is already the best-qualified ever.","506",NA
"In future, we will recruit and keep the best teachers by reducing the time they spend on paperwork,","506",NA
"introducing bursaries for the most in-demand subjects,","506",NA
"paying good teachers more,","506",NA
"further reducing the burden of Ofsted inspections","506",NA
"and continuing to encourage the growth of Teach First.","506",NA
"We will increase the number of teachers able to teach Mandarin in schools in England, so we can compete in the global race.","506",NA
"We want teachers to be regarded in the same way as other highly skilled professionals, so we are supporting the creation of an independent College of Teaching to promote the highest standards of teaching and school leadership.","506",NA
"We will lead the world in maths and science",NA,NA
"We have increased the time schools will spend on maths, and ensured that children learn to code as soon as they start school.","506",NA
"Maths is now the most popular A-level subject.","506",NA
"We aim to make Britain the best place in the world to study maths, science and engineering, measured by improved performance in the PISA league tables.","601",NA
"To help achieve this, we will train an extra 17,500 maths and physics teachers over the next five years.","506",NA
"We will make sure that all students are pushed to achieve their potential and create more opportunities to stretch the most able.","506",NA
"Schools budget protected with £5 billion given to tackle Labour’s school places crisis",NA,NA
"We will protect children",NA,NA
"Every child deserves a warm, loving home, and to feel safe online and at school.","503",NA
"We have made improving support for children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities a priority.","503",NA
"We have created 2,200 more special schools places through our free schools programme,","506",NA
"introduced a coordinated assessment process to determine a child or young person’s needs,","506",NA
"and funded degree-level specialist training for teachers and support staff.","506",NA
"And to make sure it’s working, Ofsted now formally inspects local areas for their effectiveness in fulfilling their new duties.","506",NA
"We have made progress in reforming our adoption system, but there is more to do.","504",NA
"We will introduce regional adoption agencies, working across local authority boundaries to match children with the best parents for them.","504",NA
"We will continue to raise the quality of children’s social work, by expanding training programmes, such as Frontline, and creating new opportunities to develop the next generation of leaders in the field.","504",NA
"We will continue to tackle all forms of bullying in our schools.","504",NA
"And we will stop children's exposure to harmful sexualised content online, by requiring age verification for access to all sites containing pornographic material and age-rating for all music videos.","504",NA
"We will improve skills training",NA,NA
"We have given employers much more control over apprenticeship courses, so they teach skills relevant to the workplace.","411",NA
"We will continue to replace lower-level, classroom-based Further Education courses with high-quality apprenticeships that combine training with experience of work and a wage.","411",NA
"We will ensure there is a University Technical College within reach of every city.","411",NA
"We will abolish employers' National Insurance contributions on earnings up to the upper earnings limit for apprentices under the age of 25.","402",NA
"And we will roll out many more Degree Apprenticeships, allowing young people to combine a world-class degree with a world-class apprenticeship.","411",NA
"Child poverty is down – with 300,000 fewer children living in poverty",NA,NA
"We will improve Further Education",NA,NA

"We will ensure that if you want to go to university, you can",NA,NA
"This year, for the first time, over half a million people have been admitted to our universities, including a record proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds.","506",NA
"From September, we will go even further, abolishing the cap on higher education student numbers and removing an arbitrary ceiling on ambition.","506",NA
"Our reforms to university funding mean you do not have to pay anything towards tuition while studying, and only start paying back if you earn over £21,000 per year.","506",NA
"We will ensure the continuing success and stability of these reforms, so that the interests of both students and taxpayers are fairly represented.","404",NA
"We will also introduce a national postgraduate loan system for taught masters and PhD courses.","506",NA
"We will ensure that universities deliver the best possible value for money to students:","506",NA
"we will introduce a framework to recognise universities offering the highest teaching quality;","506",NA
"encourage universities to offer more two-year courses;","506",NA

"We will ensure that our universities remain world-leading",NA,NA
"We will maintain our universities’ reputation for world-class research and academic excellence.","601",NA
"Through the Nurse Review of research councils, we will seek to ensure that the UK continues to support world-leading science, and invests public money in the best possible way.","411",NA

"The NHS is vitally important to all of us.","504",NA
"Founded on the principle that no one should ever have to worry about their ability to pay for their healthcare, it is a profound expression of our values as a nation.","601",NA
"Patients, doctors and nurses are the experts on how to improve people’s health.","504",NA
"So we have given greater power and accountability to the frontline than any other government.","504",NA
"We cleared out bureaucracy, generating savings which we have invested in care for patients.","504",NA
"Instead of chasing managerial targets, we have focused on outcomes and performance.","504",NA
"And we have given patients more power by providing them with more information.","504",NA
"Under Labour, micro-management from Whitehall clogged-up the system.","504",NA
"A cover-up culture developed, where doctors and nurses were scared to speak out about the appalling standards of care at hospitals in places such as Stafford and Morecambe Bay.","504",NA
"By the time Labour left office, our cancer survival rates lagged far behind those of other countries, and more than 18,000 patients had been waiting for over a year to start their treatment.","504",NA
"We are building an NHS that is more efficient, more effective and more accountable",NA,NA

"We have slashed the number of people who wait over a year for the treatment they need, from over 18,000 to under 500.","504",NA
"Despite this progress, our NHS faces major challenges.","504",NA
"An ageing population will place more pressure on health and social care, and life-saving but expensive new drugs will push up costs.","504",NA
"And for years it’s been too hard to access the NHS out of hours, even though sudden illness and events which you and your family cannot plan for do not respect normal working hours.","504",NA
"We will rise to these challenges.","504",NA
"By building a strong economy, we will be able to increase spending in real terms every year.","404",NA

"We have safeguarded national Green Belt protection and increased protection of important green spaces.","501",NA

"Building on the local retention of business rates introduced in 2012, we will promote localism by allowing councils to keep a higher proportion of the business rates revenue that is generated in their area.","301",NA

"Without secure energy supplies, we leave British families and business at the mercy of fluctuating global oil and gas prices;","403",NA
"we increase our dependence on foreign sources of energy; and we become less safe and less prosperous as a result.","403",NA
"National energy policy demands a willingness to take decisions today for the good of tomorrow.","403",NA
"But Labour took the opposite approach.","403",NA
"Power margins – the safety cushion we need to prevent blackouts – have fallen to record lows because of their historic failure to invest in new capacity.","403",NA
"Domestic sources of oil and gas were unexploited.","403",NA
"And Labour failed to deliver the next generation of energy projects that will help us keep the lights on, drive bills down and reduce carbon emissions.","403",NA
"All this hurt consumers.","403",NA
"The number of major energy suppliers halved and energy bills soared, with the average gas bill more than doubling.","403",NA
"We have taken a different approach.","403",NA
"Where Labour was chronically short-termist, we have secured decent, affordable energy supplies not just for the coming years, but for the coming decades.","404",NA

"the next generation of pipelines West of Shetland","404",NA

"Our tax cuts have encouraged record levels of investment in existing North Sea gas,","402",NA

"which could create many thousands of jobs.","701",NA
"Without secure energy supplies our country becomes less safe and less prosperous",NA,NA
"And we have delivered a better deal for consumers too.","403",NA
"We have demanded that energy companies simplify their tariffs;","403",NA
"encouraged more independent suppliers – which now account for ten per cent of the household market;","403",NA
"and made it much easier for people to switch energy providers.","403",NA
"But the job is only half done.","403",NA
"We need a Conservative Government to see through this long-term plan and secure clean but affordable energy supplies for generations to come.","404",NA
"This means a significant expansion in new nuclear and gas;","410",NA

"We will ensure that every home and business in the country has a Smart Meter by 2020, delivered as cost-effectively as possible, so consumers have instant, accurate bills and can switch to an alternative provider within one day.","403",NA

"We will continue to support development of North Sea oil and gas.","410",NA

"Onshore wind now makes a meaningful contribution to our energy mix and has been part of the necessary increase in renewable capacity.","416",NA
"Onshore windfarms often fail to win public support, however, and are unable by themselves to provide the firm capacity that a stable energy system requires.","416",NA
"As a result, we will end any new public subsidy for them and change the law so that local people have the final say on windfarm applications.","416",NA
"We will protect our planet for our children",NA,NA
"We have been the greenest government ever, setting up the world’s first Green Investment Bank,","501",NA
"signing a deal to build the first new nuclear plant in a generation, trebling renewable energy generation to 19 per cent,","416",NA

"Conclusion SO THIS IS OUR DETAILED PLAN FOR BRITAIN. Our plan to entrench the progress of the past five years. Our plan for you and your family, at every stage of your life. IT IS UNDERPINNED BY SOME SIMPLE CONSERVATIVE VALUES. Those who work hard and do the right thing must be rewarded. Everyone should be able to rise as high as their talents and effort will take them. We measure our success not just in how we show our strength abroad, but in how we care for the weakest and most vulnerable at home. ABOVE ALL, RUNNING THROUGH THIS PLAN  IS A TRUE BELIEF IN BRITAIN. In the past five years, as so often before in our history, we have once again defied the expectations of the world to rise up and meet our challenges. The British character is renewed every day by the millions who work hard, raise their families, care for those who need help, who do the right thing – and make this country what it is. THIS MANIFESTO IS ABOUT IMPROVING THE LIVES  OF EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THESE PEOPLE. Together we have come so far. If we stick to our long-term plan, we can secure a better future for you and your family. So let us keep moving forward; and set our sights on making our great country greater still.",NA,NA
