"Get Brexit Done","H",NA
"When the new Government entered Downing Street, the Prime Minister made a simple promise: to get Brexit done.","110",NA
"Many said it would be impossible.","305.1",NA
"But he swiftly negotiated a great new deal – despite Parliament’s best efforts to block his progress.","305.1",NA
"And then, when he put it to MPs, they insisted on yet more delay.","305.1",NA
"We must move on.","110",NA
"No more renegotiations.","110",NA
"No more referendums.","110",NA
"Every week is costing us.","110",NA
"Investment is waiting to come into the country.","110",NA
"Families and businesses cannot make vital decisions.","110",NA
"The public services cannot get the attention they deserve.","110",NA
"Our priority as Conservatives is to get Brexit done","110",NA
"– so that we can unleash the potential of this great country.","601.1",NA
"So that we can push past the obstacles that other parties have put in our country’s way.","305.1",NA
"So that we can deliver on the people’s decision in 2016","202.1",NA
"and use our new post-Brexit freedoms to transform the UK for the better by focusing on your priorities.","110",NA
"If we elect a majority of Conservative MPs to Parliament, we will start putting our deal through Parliament before Christmas and we will leave the European Union in January.","110",NA
"Boris Johnson’s new deal takes the whole country out of the EU as one United Kingdom.","110",NA
"It takes us out of the customs union,","407",NA
"allowing us to set our own tariffs","406",NA
"and do our own trade deals.","406",NA
"It allows us to pass our own laws and ensures that it is our courts that enforce them.","601.1",NA
"Our deal is the only one on the table.","305.1",NA
"It is signed, sealed and ready.","305.1",NA
"It puts the whole country on a path to a new free trade agreement with the EU.","407",NA
"This will be a new relationship based on free trade and friendly cooperation,","407",NA
"not on the EU’s treaties","110",NA
"or EU law.","110",NA
"There will be no political alignment with the EU.","110",NA
"We will keep the UK out of the single market,","110",NA
"out of any form of customs union,","110",NA
"and end the role of the European Court of Justice.","110",NA
"This future relationship will be one that allows us to: Take back control of our laws.","601.1",NA
"Take back control of our money.","401",NA
"Control our own trade policy.","401",NA
"Introduce an Australian-style points-based immigration system.","601.2",NA
"Raise standards in areas like workers’ rights,","701",NA
"animal welfare,","501",NA
"agriculture","703.1",NA
"and the environment.","501",NA
"Ensure we are in full control of our fishing waters.","406",NA
"We will negotiate a trade agreement next year","407",NA
"– one that will strengthen our Union –","601.1",NA
"and we will not extend the implementation period beyond December 2020.","110",NA
"In parallel, we will legislate to ensure high standards of workers’ rights,","701",NA
"environmental protection","501",NA
"and consumer rights.","403",NA
"The only way to deliver Brexit is with a Conservative majority in Parliament.","110",NA
"A vote for any other party or candidate is a vote for Jeremy Corbyn","305.2",NA
"– and a vote for more chaos.","305.3",NA
"Unleash Britain’s Potential","H",NA
"For the past nine years, the Conservatives have been cleaning up Labour’s mess.","305.1",NA
"Because of the tough decisions that our party made and our success in bringing down the deficit ,","414",NA
"the economy has continued to grow ,","410",NA
"and the public finances have been restored.","414",NA
"Thanks to Conservative policies, employment is at a near-record high.","701",NA
"We’ve helped millions of people into work, halving the unemployment rate.","701",NA
"We’ve doubled the personal allowance to £12,500, meaning that every worker gets to keep more of what they earn.","401",NA
"We’ve introduced and consistently raised the National Living Wage","412",NA
"– and will raise it still further.","412",NA
"The strength of the UK’s balance sheet – the hard work done by all of us in this country – means that we are now in a position to invest properly in our future.","414",NA
"A Conservative Government will give the public services the resources they need, supporting our hospitals,","504",NA
"our schools","506",NA
"and our police.","605.1",NA
"We will help people and families throughout their lives by bringing down the cost of living","503",NA
"and making sure that work always pays.","701",NA
"We will keep costs down for small businesses – rather than hiking their taxes and crushing Britain’s prosperity.","403",NA
"We will not borrow to fund day-to-day spending,","414",NA
"but will invest thoughtfully and responsibly in infrastructure right across our country","411",NA
"in order to increase productivity and","410",NA
"wages.","701",NA
"Our fiscal rules mean that public sector net investment will not average more than 3 per cent of GDP,","414",NA
"and that if debt interest reaches 6 per cent of revenue, we will reassess our plans to keep debt under control.","414",NA
"This means that debt will be lower at the end of the Parliament –","414",NA
"rather than spiralling out of control under Labour.","305.1",NA
"And we will use this investment prudently and strategically to level up every part of the United Kingdom,","414",NA
"while strengthening the ties that bind it together.","601.1",NA
"We will also prioritise the environment in the next Budget,","501",NA
"investing in the infrastructure, science and research that will deliver economic growth, not just through the 2020s, but for decades to come.","411",NA
"Above all, we will listen to the people who have felt left behind by the last few decades of economic growth and want to have more control of their future.","503",NA
"We will get Brexit done, so we can unleash Britain’s potential.","110",NA
"so we can unleash Britain’s potential.","601.1",NA
"We Will Focus On Your Priorities","H",NA
"In his first months in office, the Prime Minister has shown how he intends to make life better for everyone in the UK.","503",NA
"Supporting our police.","605.1",NA
"Increasing funding for our schools.","505",NA
"Building new hospitals.","504",NA
"We have listened to you, and we have acted.","601.1",NA
"Acted to ensure that we deliver world-class public services so that you can have the help and support you need throughout your life.","503",NA
"And we want to take that agenda further.","305.1",NA
"But none of it will happen without a Conservative majority Government.","305.1",NA
"Strengthen the NHS and social care","H",NA
"The NHS represents the best of this country.","601.1",NA
"It is there for us when our children are born, when our friends and families fall sick, when our loved ones succumb to old age and ill health.","504",NA
"It is precious to all of us – especially because it is free at the point of use and there for you on the basis of need, not your ability to pay.","504",NA
"We as Conservatives believe passionately in the NHS.","504",NA
"Because we believe that everyone deserves the chance to live free of sickness and disease –","504",NA
"and to know that if they do fall ill, our brilliant NHS staff will be there for them.","504",NA
"We are proud that since its foundation, it is the Conservative Party that has acted as the steward and guardian of the NHS and its principles for 44 of its 71 years.","504",NA
"We are proud that it is coping with increasing demand, with more doctors and nurses,","504",NA
"and using more advanced treatments than ever before.","504",NA
"And we are proud to have confirmed a record £34 billion per year by the end of the Parliament in additional funding for the NHS","504",NA
"– and to have begun work on building 40 new hospitals across the country,","411",NA
"as well as investing in hospital upgrades and new machines to boost early cancer diagnosis across 78 hospital trusts.","504",NA
"But we want to do more.","504",NA
"Within the first three months of our new term, we will enshrine in law our fully funded, long-term NHS plan.","504",NA
"This is the largest cash settlement in NHS history.","504",NA
"One that is only possible because we have delivered the growth and prosperity to pay for world-class public services –","410",NA
"and will continue to do so.","504",NA
"Between 2018 and 2023, we will have raised funding for the NHS by 29 per cent.","504",NA
"By the end of the Parliament, that will be more than £650 million extra a week.","504",NA
"And we will ensure this money goes to the frontline so that you and your family get appointments more quickly and experience improved care.","504",NA
"We believe that the best way to improve the NHS and meet rising demand is to invest in its most important asset – its people.","504",NA
"That is why we are devoting additional funding, on top of our existing record settlement, to hire and support more doctors, nurses and other health professionals.","504",NA
"Our NHS Prevention and Treatment Plan","H",NA
"We will build and fund 40 new hospitals over the next 10 years.","411",NA
"This is on top of the 20 hospital upgrades announced in the summer.","504",NA
"We will roll out cancer diagnostic machines across 78 hospital trusts to boost early diagnosis.","411",NA
"We are committed to reducing health inequality.","503",NA
"We will continue to repair the damage done by Labour’s disastrous PFI deals.","305.1",NA
"We will invest in preventing disease as well as curing it.","504",NA
"We will tackle the underlying causes of increases in NHS demand, for example via a long-term strategy for empowering people with lifestyle-related conditions such as obesity to live healthier lives","505",NA
", as well as tackling childhood obesity, heart disease and diabetes.","504",NA
"We will continue to promote the uptake of vaccines via our national vaccination strategy.","504",NA
"We will extend social prescribing and expand the new National Academy of Social Prescribing.","504",NA
"We will overhaul NHS screening and use new technology and mobile screening services to prevent ill health.","411",NA
"We will focus on helping patients with multiple conditions to have simplified and more joined-up access to the NHS.","503",NA
"And we will improve hospital food alongside our wider National Food Strategy.","504",NA
"We will develop new treatments for serious diseases.","504",NA
"We will extend the successful Cancer Drugs Fund into an Innovative Medicines Fund so that doctors can use the most advanced, life-saving treatments for conditions such as cancer or autoimmune disease,","504",NA
"or for children with other rare diseases.","504",NA
"If you or a loved one is unlucky enough to fall ill, we’ll ensure you have access to the best available medicines.","503",NA
"We will also improve the early diagnosis and treatment of all major conditions.","504",NA
"We will treat mental health with the same urgency as physical health.","504",NA
"We will legislate so that patients suffering from mental health conditions, including anxiety or depression, have greater control over their treatment","504",NA
"and receive the dignity and respect they deserve.","503",NA
"We will make it easier for people with learning disabilities and autism to be discharged from hospital","503",NA
"and improve how they are treated in law.","503",NA
"We will continue to take action to tackle gambling addiction.","504",NA
"We will improve NHS performance, using our record funding settlementnto bring down operating waiting times,","504",NA
"improve A&E performance","504",NA
"and increase cancer survival rates.","504",NA
"We will study carefully the recommendations of the ongoing review led by NHS clinical staff into A&E and clinical performance.","504",NA
"We will use frontline technology to improve patients’ experience,","411",NA
"provide flexible working for clinicians,","701",NA
"and help save lives.","504",NA
"We will also hold an annual health technology summit.","411",NA
"We will support our precious hospices, developing the plans already announced by Boris Johnson to secure their future, with a £25 million cash injection in August to support 200,000 people at the end of their lives.","504",NA
"We will make the NHS the best place in the world to give birth through personalised, high-quality support.","504",NA
"And we’ll uphold our commitment to extend healthy life expectancy by five years by 2035.","504",NA
"We will end unfair hospital car parking charges by making parking free for those in greatest need, including disabled people, frequent outpatient attenders, parents of sick children staying overnight","503",NA
"and staff working night shifts.","701",NA
"This will eliminate costs for those in need, while making sure there are enough spaces for everyone.","503",NA
"We will clamp down on health tourism, ensuring that those from overseas who use NHS services pay their fair share.","503",NA
"And we will increase the NHS surcharge paid by those from overseas.","403",NA
"When we are negotiating trade deals, the NHS will not be on the table.","406",NA
"The price the NHS pays for drugs will not be on the table.","406",NA
"The services the NHS provides will not be on the table.","406",NA
"Our NHS People Plan","H",NA
"The 1.4 million dedicated staff who deliver world-class care day in, day out are at the heart of the NHS.","701",NA
"Our core priority is to make sure this workforce can grow and has the support it needs – in terms of numbers, training and resources.","701",NA
"That means that if you do fall ill, you’ll get the care and attention you deserve.","504",NA
"We will deliver: 50,000 more nurses,","504",NA
"with students receiving a £5,000-£8,000 annual maintenance grant every year during their course to help with their costof living – and they won’t have to pay it back.","504",NA
"Everyone will receive at least£5,000","504",NA
"with further funding in regions or disciplines that are struggling to recruit – such as mental health –","504",NA
"and help with their childcare costs.","504",NA
"6,000 more doctors in general practice","504",NA
"and 6,000 more primary care professionals, such as physiotherapists and pharmacists.","504",NA
"This is on top of the 7,500 extra nurse associates","504",NA
"and 20,000 primary care professionals that we have already announced.","504",NA
"We will improve staff morale with more funding for professional training and more supportive hospital management.","504",NA
"We will introduce an NHS Visa.","602.2",NA
"Our NHS People Plan will ensure that we train and employ tens of thousands more NHS professionals here in the UK.","504",NA
"But we also want to make sure that those from overseas who want to work in and support our NHS are encouraged to do so.","602.2",NA
"That is why qualified doctors, nurses and allied health professionals with a job offer from the NHS, who have been trained to a recognised standard, and who have good working English, will be offered fast-track entry,","602.2",NA
"reduced visa fees","602.2",NA
"and dedicated support to come to the UK with their families.","602.2",NA
"Our new funding will deliver 50 million extra general practice appointments a year, an increase of over 15 per cent.","504",NA
"That means that if you need an appointment, waiting times will be shorter and you’ll get the service you deserve.","504",NA
"We also want to make sure that doctors spend as much time as possible treating patients, so we will","504",NA
"address the ‘taper problem’ in doctors’ pensions, which causes many to turn down extra shifts for fear of high tax bills.","402",NA
"Within our first 30 days, we will hold an urgent review, working with the British Medical Association and Academy of Medical Royal Colleges to solve the problem.","402",NA
"Improving social care","H",NA
"It is a basic, compassionate Conservative belief that we should care for those in need – helping those who cannot help themselves.","503",NA
"Thanks to decades of economic growth and scientific innovation, people are living longer, healthier lives.","503",NA
"But this, alongside the rise of dementia and other chronic conditions, means that the pressures on the elderly care system are ever-increasing.","504",NA
"There has also been significant growth in the number of working-age people with disabilities who need care at a younger age.","503",NA
"We need to have a system to give every person the dignity and security that they deserve.","503",NA
"This is a significant and complex challenge and in order to lay the foundations, we must plan for the infrastructure, workforce growth and healthcare integration that is required for a care system fit for the 21st century.","504",NA
"Because this is a long-term problem that will affect so many people, any solution has to be able to survive long-term.","404",NA
"We must build the same level of consensus on social care as we have already built on the NHS.","404",NA
"So we will build a cross-party consensus to bring forward an answer that solves the problem, commands the widest possible support, and stands the test of time.","404",NA
"That consensus will consider a range of options but one condition we do make is that nobody needing care should be forced to sell their home to pay for it.","403",NA
"As a first step, and to stabilise the system, we announced in the autumn additional funding of £1 billion for the year beginning in April 2020.","504",NA
"We are now confirming this additional funding in every year of the new Parliament.","504",NA
"We will also extend the entitlement to leave for unpaid carers, the majority of whom are women, to one week.","504",NA
"We also want to save millions of people, and their families, from suffering the agony of a slow decline due to dementia.","504",NA
"We will make finding a cure one of our Government’s biggest collective priorities – one of the ‘grand challenges’ that will define our future","411",NA
"along with the impact of climate change","501",NA
"or artificial intelligence.","411",NA
"This will include doubling research funding into dementia and speeding up trials for new treatments.","411",NA
"We will also provide £74 million over three years for additional capacity in community care settings for those with learning disabilities and autism.","504",NA
"We need a long-term solution for social care – that’s why we are committing to an ambitious three-point plan: £1 billion extra of funding every year for more social care staff","504",NA
"and better infrastructure, technology and facilities.","411",NA
"We will commit to urgently seek a cross-party consensus in order to bring forward the necessary proposal and legislation for long-term reform.","404",NA
"The prerequisite of any solution will be a guarantee that no one needing care has to sell their home to pay for it.","503",NA
"Invest in our schools","H",NA
"Talent is evenly spread in this country, but opportunity is not.","503",NA
"As Conservatives, we believe absolutely in equality of opportunity – the idea that every child, in every part of the country, should have a fair chance.","503",NA
"It is not only the most important thing we can do to unleash the UK’s potential, but is at the heart of creating a fair and just society.","503",NA
"This is why we want to ensure every child has access to a great state school","506",NA
"– that every pupil gets the qualifications they need for a prosperous future,","506",NA
"while learning in an environment where they will be happy and fulfilled.","506",NA
"In his first months in office, Boris Johnson announced an extra £14 billion in funding for schools.","506",NA
"That translates to £150 million a week, and will include at least £5,000 a year for each secondary school pupil","506",NA
"and at least £4,000 for each primary school pupil.","506",NA
"This also includes £780 million in new funding to support children with Special Educational Needs next year alone.","506",NA
"One of the Conservative Party’s proudest achievements is that we have raised standards in our schools and improved behaviour.","305.1",NA
"Students learn best when they are stretched, challenged and nurtured – in an environment where there is no disruption and no excuses for bad behaviour.","506",NA
"In the last nine years, the percentage of children passing their primary reading check has gone up from 58 per cent to 82 per cent.","506",NA
"We have strengthened teachers’ powers to deal with bullying and disruption.","506",NA
"We have given schools the ability to decide how money is best spent – because we trust parents and headteachers to know what is best for the children in their care.","201.1",NA
"For our children to get the training and opportunities they deserve, they need to have the best teachers.","506",NA
"We want tonattract the best talent into teaching and recognise the great work they do, so we’re raising teachers’ starting salaries to £30,000 – among the most competitive in the graduate labour market.","412",NA
"We also want to build on our record of raising standards, improving behaviour","603",NA
"and promoting knowledge and creativity.","506",NA
"We will back heads and teachers on discipline.","603",NA
"We will expand our programme to help schools with the worst behaviour learn from the best –","506",NA
"and back heads to use exclusions.","201.1",NA
"Unlike Labour, we believe that Ofsted inspection serves a valuable purpose not just in improving standards but in improving behaviour.","603",NA
"We will continue to help teachers tackle bullying, including homophobic bullying.","503",NA
"No child should be bullied on account of who their parents are or where they come from.","503",NA
"We will create more great schools.","506",NA
"We will continue to do everything we can to ensure every school is a great school.","506",NA
"We will continue to support innovation, like our successful maths schools, set up for the most gifted young physicists and mathematicians.","506",NA
"We will expand ‘alternative provision’ schools for those who have been excluded.","503",NA
"We will also deliver more school places for children with complex Special Educational Needs.","506",NA
"We will intervene in schools where there is entrenched underperformance.","506",NA
"We will continue to ensure that parents can choose the schools that best suit their children and best prepare them for the future.","506",NA
"And we will continue to build more free schools.","201.1",NA
"We will invest in arts, music and sport.","502",NA
"Over the last nine years we have made real improvements in maths, English and science, and given more children access to a rich academic curriculum.","506",NA
"We retain our commitment to the core subjects and also want young people to learn creative skills and widen their horizons, so we will offer an ‘arts premium’ to secondary schools to fund enriching activities for all pupils.","502",NA
"And to ensure children are getting an active start to life, we will invest in primary school PE teaching and ensure that it is being properly delivered.","502",NA
"We want to do more to help schools make good use of their sports facilities and to promote physical literacy and competitive sport.","502",NA
"Vulnerable children","H",NA
"Children who end up in care are more likely to struggle as adults, denied the love and stability most of us take for granted.","603",NA
"We will prioritise stable, loving placements for those children – adoption where possible or foster parents recruited by the local authority.","503",NA
"We will review the care system to make sure that all care placements and settings are providing children and young adults with the support they need.","503",NA
"A strong society needs strong families.","603",NA
"We will improve the Troubled Families programme and champion Family Hubs to serve vulnerable families with the intensive, integrated support they need to care for children – from the early years and throughout their lives.","603",NA
"Support working families","H",NA
"Since 2010, the Conservatives have helped more than 1,000 people on average into work every day","701",NA
"That is an extraordinary figure.","305.1",NA
"And it has only been possible because of the strong economy we have helped to create;","402",NA
"our support for business;","402",NA
"and our welfare reforms, which have encouraged more people into work.","505",NA
"The majority of jobs created since 2010 have been high-quality: full-time","701",NA
"and outside London and the South East.","503",NA
"Whoever you are, we want to make it easier for you to get a good and rewarding job","701",NA
"– and to be able to combine a rewarding career with raising a family or caring for elderly or disabled relatives, rather than being forced to prioritise between them.","701",NA
"We want to make sure that you get to keep more of the money you earn,","401",NA
"and that we keep your bills low.","503",NA
"And we want to make sure that those who can’t work, or have entered retirement, get the level of support they need.","504",NA
"We have focused, over the past decade, on making sure that work always pays – particularly for those most in need of support.","505",NA
"We have raised the minimum wage significantly","412",NA
"and introduced and consistently raised the National Living Wage.","412",NA
"We have doubled the personal allowance to £12,500, so that everyone gets to earn a decent amount before they are taxed.","503",NA
"And we have made sure the state pension keeps pace with earnings.","504",NA
"In our first months, we announced an increase in the National Living Wage to two thirds of average earnings, currently forecast at £10.50 an hour,","412",NA
"and widened its reach to everyone over 21.","412",NA
"That means an average pay rise of£4,000 per year for four million people by 2024.","412",NA
"To help young people get a foot on the employment ladder, we abolished employers’ National Insurance Contributions for under-21s","701",NA
"and apprentices under 25.","701",NA
"Creating millions more jobs is one of the Conservatives’ proudest achievements.","701",NA
"A Labour Government that makes it harder for businesses to grow and to hire –","402",NA
"that allows people to sink into dependency rather than encouraging them to work and earn – could undo all of this progress.","505",NA
"A majority Conservative Government will deliver a major package of measures designed to ensure that it always pays to work,","505",NA
"while doing everything we can to protect and support those who cannot","504",NA
"– and to address the cost of living pressures that we all face.","503",NA
"We promise not to raise the rates of income tax, National Insurance or VAT.","401",NA
"This is a tax guarantee that will protect the incomes of hard-working families across the next Parliament.","701",NA
"We not only want to freeze taxes, but to cut them too.","401",NA
"We will raise the National Insurance threshold to £9,500 next year – representing a tax cut for 31 million workers.","401",NA
"Our ultimate ambition is to ensure that the first £12,500 you earn is completely free of tax – which would put almost £500 per year in people’s pockets.","401",NA
"Raising a family should be the most fulfilling experience of your life.","603",NA
"But for too many parents, the costs of childcare are a heavy burden.","503",NA
"We want to give parents the freedom, support and choice to look after their children in the way that works best for them.","201.1",NA
"We will establish a new £1 billion fund to help create more high quality, affordable childcare, including before and after school and during the school holidays.","504",NA
"For many families, energy costs are a major source of financial pressure.","403",NA
"We will keep our existing energy cap and introduce new measures to lower bills.","403",NA
"We will also give the Competition and Markets Authority enhanced powers to tackle consumer rip-offs and bad business practices.","403",NA
"We recognise that water bills can be a major source of financial pressure, so will extend the water rebate for those in the South West.","403",NA
"On entering Government in 2010, the Conservatives acted decisively to protect the UK’s pensioners.","504",NA
"The ‘triple lock’ we introduced has meant that those who have worked hard and put in for decades can be confident that the state will be there to support them when they need it.","701",NA
"We will keep the triple lock, the winter fuel payment, the older person’s bus pass and other pensioner benefits, ensuring that older people have the security and dignity they deserve.","503",NA
"We recognise the value of free TV licences for over-75s and believe they should be funded by the BBC.","403",NA
"A number of workers, disproportionately women, who earn between £10,000 and £12,500 have been missing out on pension benefits because of a loophole affecting people with net pay pension schemes.","701",NA
"We will conduct a comprehensive review to look at how to fix this issue.","701",NA
"We will use our freedom from the EU to improve the UK’s tax regime","110",NA
"not least by abolishing the tampon tax.","503",NA
"We as Conservatives believe that everyone who can work, should work – and that it should always pay them to do so.","505",NA
"But we also believe that those who truly can’t work must be given the help they need.","504",NA
"That is why we will continue the roll-out of Universal Credit, which combines multiple benefits into one while building a clearer pathway from welfare into work.","505",NA
"We have already acted to increase work allowances, a move worth £630 to working families with children,","504",NA
"and those with disabilities,","504",NA

"Fix our immigration system","H",NA
"The vote to leave the EU was, among other things, a vote to take back control of our borders.","110",NA
"That is why a majority Conservative Government will get Brexit done,","110",NA
"and then introduce a firmer and fairer Australian-style points-based immigration system,","601.2",NA

"Integration and openness","H",NA

"We will continue to grant asylum and support to refugees fleeing persecution, with the ultimate aim of helping them to return home if it is safe to do so.","201.2",NA
"We will champion freedom of expression and tolerance, both in the UK and overseas.","201.2",NA
"We will ensure that the historic contribution of migrant groups is recognised.","606.1",NA
"We will maintain our support for a memorial recognising the contribution of the Windrush Generation in a prominent site in London.","606.1",NA
"Contributing to our country","H",NA
"It is a basic point of principle – and natural justice – that you should not be able to take out before you have put in.","503",NA
"Of course we should help those in genuine need – especially those who have fled from persecution.","201.2",NA
"But at the same time, it is both right and fair that, as in other countries, people making the UK their home should pay into the tax system for a reasonable period of time before they can access welfare.","505",NA
"Our new immigration system will mean: People coming into the country from the EU will only be able to access unemployment, housing, and child benefit after five years, in the way non-EEA migrants currently do.","505",NA
"We will no longer allow people to claim child benefit for children living overseas.","505",NA
"We will require new arrivals to contribute to the funding of the NHS and will increase the health surcharge to ensure it covers the full cost of use.","505",NA
"and will increase the health surcharge to ensure it covers the full cost of use.","505",NA
"We will also enforce charges on those who come to our country and use our health services without contributing, doubling the budget for our health tourism enforcement unit.","505",NA
"We will continue to offer free emergency care to anyone who needs it.","505",NA
"In order to help communities cope better with pressures on public services, we will ensure that new GP and school places are delivered ahead of people moving into new housing developments,","504",NA
"and will invest in technical skills and work incentives so British workers take up as many jobs as possible.","601.2",NA
"This is a package of measures that is fair, firm and compassionate – that brings the immigration system, after so many years, into line with the British people’s own sense of what is right.","601.1",NA
"But we cannot do any of it unless we have a strong Conservative Government that can get Brexit done.","110",NA
"We Will Unleash Britain’s Potential","H",NA
"Getting Brexit done allows us to focus on making this the best possible place to live and work –","601.1",NA
"to use our post-Brexit freedoms to build prosperity and strengthen and level up every part of the country.","110",NA
"Because it is not just Britain’s potential that we want to unleash, but that of the British people.","601.1",NA
"Our plan means making sure people have access to world-class public services,","601.1",NA
"that they feel safe on the streets,","605.1",NA
"that working families get to keep more of their own money,","401",NA
"and that we help with cost of living pressures.","403",NA
"But it also means making sure that we share prosperity across the country, addressing the longstanding economic challenges in parts of the country.","503",NA
"We will invest responsibly and prudently in the infrastructure that can make a difference,","411",NA
"and ensure communities in every corner of the United Kingdom are pleasant, safe and prosperous.","503",NA

"Investing in people,","701",NA
"restoring the fabric of our towns and cities,","601.1",NA
"building the homes we need,","411",NA

"bstrengthening the great Union between the United Kingdom’s four nations – that is how we will unleash our country’s full potential.","601.1",NA
"We are the only party that can deliver this programme, because we are the only party that understands the symmetry at the heart of the UK economy.","305.1",NA
"That the only way to fund world-class public services and outstanding infrastructure is to encourage the millions of British businesses that create the wealth of the nation –","402",NA
"especially small businesses, family firms and the self-employed.","403",NA
"We stand for the people working every hour they can,","401",NA
"those taking a risk on a new idea,","401",NA
"those challenging existing markets.","401",NA
"Their success is our success.","401",NA
"And we stand for those who give their time to help others – the charities, community groups and volunteers who already do so much to make our country a better place.","606.1",NA
"We believe, in other words, that Britain is a great country – the greatest place on earth.","601.1",NA
"Together, we can make it greater still.","601.1",NA
"Revive our towns and cities","H",NA
"People across the UK are rightly proud of where they come from, and of their local areas.","601.1",NA

"Violent crime and anti-social behaviour are ignored amid a backdrop of boarded-up department stores, shops and pubs.","601.1",NA
"Great towns and cities are being held back.","601.1",NA
"We as Conservatives want to give you freedom – low taxes, opportunity, the chance to realise your dreams.","201.1",NA
"But we also want to give you security – safe and pleasant streets, and the ability to take pride and comfort from the community around you.","601.1",NA
"This is why, in his first months as Prime Minister, Boris Johnson has set out an agenda for levelling up every part of the UK – not just investing in our great towns and cities, as well as rural and coastal areas, but giving them far more control of how that investment is made.","301",NA
"In the 21st century, we need to get away from the idea that ‘Whitehall knows best’ and that all growth must inevitably start in London.","301",NA
"Because we as Conservatives believe you can and must trust people and communities to make the decisions that are right for them.","301",NA
"To underpin this national renewal, we will invest £100 billion in additional infrastructure spending – on roads, rail","411",NA
"and other responsible, productive investment which will repair and refurbish the fabric of our country and generate greater growth in the long run.","416.2",NA
"For example, flood defences will receive £4 billion in new funding.","501",NA
"We will ensure that we are always spending what we can afford – with strict limits on borrowing and repayment costs.","414",NA

"A transport revolution","H",NA
"A key part of our plan to level up the UK’s cities and regions is to connect them.","411",NA
"Leeds is the largest city in Western Europe without a light rail or metro system.","411",NA
"And European cities are often more productive than our own in large part because they have better infrastructure.","411",NA
"We will connect our cities:","H",NA
"We will build Northern Powerhouse Rail between Leeds and Manchester and then focus on Liverpool, Tees Valley, Hull, Sheffield and Newcastle.","411",NA
"We will invest in the Midlands Rail Hub, strengthening rail links including those between Birmingham, Leicester, Nottingham, Coventry, Derby, Hereford and Worcester.","411",NA
"We will also invest in improving train lines to the South West and East Anglia.","411",NA
"We will extend contactless pay-as-you go ticketing to almost 200 more stations in the South East, meaning that 50 per cent of all rail journeys and almost all London commuter journeys can be completed using a contactless bank card.","411",NA
"We will give city regions the funding to upgrade their bus, tram and train services to make them as good as London’s,","301",NA
"with more frequent, better-integrated services,","411",NA
"more electrification,","411",NA
"modern buses and trains","411",NA
"and smart ticketing – such as the vision proposed by Andy Street for the West Midlands.","411",NA
"The railways need accountability, not nationalisation.","403",NA
"So we will end the complicated franchising model and create a simpler, more effective rail system,","403",NA
"including giving metro mayors control over services in their areas.","301",NA
"We will make a £28.8 billion investment in strategic and local roads.","411",NA
"We will invest £1 billion in completing a fast-charging network to ensure that everyone is within 30 miles of a rapid electric vehicle charging station.","411",NA
"We will consult on the earliest date we can phase out the sale of new conventional petrol and diesel cars,","416.2",NA
"while minimising the impact on drivers","403",NA
"and businesses.","402",NA
"We will require that a minimum service operates during transport strikes.","403",NA
"Rail workers deserve a fair deal, but it is not fair to let the trade unions undermine the livelihoods of others.","702",NA
"HS2 is a great ambition, but will now cost at least £81 billion and will not reach Leeds or Manchester until as late as 2040.","303",NA
"We will consider the findings of the Oakervee review into costs and timings and work with leaders of the Midlands and the North to decide the optimal outcome.","303",NA
"Connectivity is not just about the UK’s great cities.","H",NA
"To help communities across the country, we will restore many of the Beeching lines, reconnecting smaller towns such as Fleetwood and Willenhall that have suffered permanent disadvantage since they were removed from the rail network in the 1960s.","411",NA
"We will invest in superbus networks","411",NA
"with lower fares","403",NA

"We will create a new £350 million Cycling Infrastructure Fund with mandatory design standards for new routes.","411",NA
"We will extend Bikeability – cycling proficiency training – to every child.","506",NA

"Parliament has voted in principle to support a third runway at Heathrow, but it is a private sector project.","411",NA
"It is for Heathrow to demonstrate that it can meet its air quality and noise obligations,","416.2",NA
"that the project can be financed and built and that the business case is realistic.","401",NA

"We are proud that Conservative councils have led the way in helping keep council taxes low, providing value for money and supporting local communities.","303",NA
"We will ensure that councils continue to deliver essential local services – which is why they received a substantial funding increase in the most recent Spending Round.","301",NA
"Local people will continue to have the final say on council tax, being able to veto excessive rises.","201.1",NA
"This does not prevent councils raising more – but it does ensure that they will need to have solid and convincing reasons for doing so.","201.1",NA
"We remain committed to devolving power to people and places across the UK.","202.1",NA
"Our ambition is for full devolution across England, building on the successful devolution of powers to city region mayors, Police and Crime Commissioners and others, so that every part of our country has the power to shape its own destiny.","301",NA
"We will publish an English Devolution White Paper setting out our plans next year.","301",NA
"Through our City and Growth Deals we have already delivered more than £9 billion of funding across England,","301",NA
"and almost £3 billion to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.","301",NA
"Through bodies like the Northern Powerhouse, Western Gateway and Midlands Engine we will drive greater levels of foreign investment into the UK, promoting our towns, cities and counties around the world.","301",NA
"As part of our plans for full devolution we will also invite proposals from local areas for similar growth bodies across the rest of England, such as the Oxford-Cambridge Arc.","301",NA
"This is an agenda which shows that the days of Whitehall knows best are over.","301",NA
"We will give towns, cities and communities of all sizes across the UK real power and real investment to drive the growth of the future and unleash their full potential.","301",NA
"Helping people buy and rent","H",NA
"The biggest problem that young people face in getting on the housing ladder is the deposit.","403",NA
"There are more than three million people, many of them with good jobs and secure prospects, who would have been homeowners before the economic crisis in 2008 but have been locked out of the mortgage market.","403",NA
"We will encourage a new market in long-term fixed rate mortgages which slash the cost of deposits, opening up a secure path to home ownership for first-time buyers in all parts of the United Kingdom.","403",NA
"We will offer more homes to local families, enabling councils to use developers’ contributions via the planning process to discount homes in perpetuity by a third for local people who cannot otherwise afford to buy in their area.","403",NA
"Councils could use this to prioritise key workers in their area, like police, nurses and teachers.","403",NA
"We will maintain our commitment to a Right to Buy for all council tenants.","401",NA
"We will also maintain the voluntary Right to Buy scheme agreed with housing associations.","401",NA
"Following the successful voluntary pilot scheme in the Midlands, we will evaluate new pilot areas in order to spread the dream of home ownership to even more people.","401",NA
"And we have extended the Help to Buy scheme from 2021 to 2023 and will review new ways to support home ownership following its completion.","401",NA
"We will reform shared ownership, making it fairer and more transparent.","403",NA
"We will simplify shared ownership products by setting a single standard for all housing associations, thereby ending the confusion and disparity between different schemes.","403",NA
"We will continue with our reforms to leasehold including implementing our ban on the sale of new leasehold homes,","403",NA
"restricting ground rents to a peppercorn,","403",NA
"and providing necessary mechanisms of redress for tenants.","403",NA
"We will bring in a Better Deal for Renters, including abolishing ‘no fault’ evictions","403",NA
"and only requiring one ‘lifetime’ deposit which moves with the tenant.","403",NA
"This will create a fairer rental market:","403",NA
"if you’re a tenant, you will be protected from revenge evictions and rogue landlords,","403",NA
"and if you’re one of the many good landlords, we will strengthen your rights of possession.","201.1",NA
"Deliver the housing people need","H",NA
"Home ownership is one of the most fundamental Conservative values.","401",NA
"People are happier, more secure and more rooted in their communities when they own their own home – and know that they can pass it on to future generations.","401",NA
"For the UK to unleash its potential, young people need the security of knowing that home ownership is within their reach – that they too can have a tangible stake in society,","403",NA
"can be rooted in their communities","606.1",NA
"and have a place to raise a family.","603",NA
"A majority Conservative Government will continue to increase the number of homes being built.","410",NA
"But we must also rebalance the housing market towards more home ownership –","401",NA
"while ensuring fairness for the new generation of renters.","403",NA
"While we want to encourage as many people as possible into home ownership,","401",NA
"we recognise that not everyone can afford their own home – and that those in social housing deserve the same dignity, respect and fair treatment as private renters.","503",NA
"As Boris Johnson has promised, we will bring forward a Social Housing White Paper which will set out further measures to empower tenants and support the continued supply of social homes.","504",NA
"This will include measures to provide greater redress,","403",NA
"better regulation","403",NA
"and improve the quality of social housing.","504",NA
"We will also commit to renewing the Affordable Homes Programme, in order to support the delivery of hundreds of thousands of affordable homes.","403",NA
"This is a key part of our efforts to prevent people from falling into homelessness,","504",NA
"along with fully enforcing the Homelessness Reduction Act.","504",NA
"We will also end the blight of rough sleeping by the end of the next Parliament by expanding successful pilots and programmes such as the Rough Sleeping Initiative and Housing First,","504",NA
"and working to bring together local services to meet the health and housing needs of people sleeping on the streets.","504",NA
"We will help pay for this by bringing in a stamp duty surcharge on non-UK resident buyers.","403",NA
"Places we want to live in","H",NA
"Since 2010 there has been a considerable increase in homebuilding.","404",NA
"We have delivered a million homes in the last five years in England:","404",NA
"last year, we delivered the highest number of homes for almost 30 years.","404",NA
"But it still isn’t enough.","404",NA
"That is why we will continue our progress towards our target of 300,000 homes a year by the mid-2020s.","404",NA
"This will see us build at least a million more homes, of all tenures, over the next Parliament – in the areas that really need them.","403",NA
"And we will make the planning system simpler for the public and small builders,","303",NA
"and support modern methods of construction.","411",NA
"Crucially, however, we need to make sure homes are built in a way that makes sense for the people already living in the area and for the families moving in:","416.2",NA
"Infrastructure first.","H",NA
"We will amend planning rules so that the infrastructure – roads, schools, GP surgeries – comes before people move into new homes.","411",NA
"And our new £10 billion Single Housing Infrastructure Fund will help deliver it faster.","411",NA
"Beautiful, high-quality homes.","H",NA
"We will ask every community to decide on its own design standards for new development, allowing residents a greater say on the style and design of development in their area,","416.2",NA
"with local councils encouraged to build more beautiful architecture.","416.2",NA
"Building safety.","H",NA
"Following the Grenfell tragedy there has rightly been a focus on building safety.","403",NA
"No report or review can truly capture the heartache, sorrow, anger and grief that many people feel.","503",NA
"We have already committed to implementing and legislating for all the recommendations of the Hackitt Review and the first phase of the independent inquiry.","403",NA
"We will continue to work with industry, housing associations and individuals to ensure every home is safe and secure.","403",NA
"And we will support high rise residential residents with the removal of unsafe cladding,","403",NA
"and continue with our rigorous process of materials testing.","403",NA
"Community housing and self-build.","H",NA
"We will support community housing by helping people who want to build their own homes find plots of land and access the Help to Buy scheme.","401",NA
"We will also support communities living on council estates who want to take ownership of the land and buildings they live in.","505",NA
"Environmentally friendly homes.","H",NA
"We will support the creation of new kinds of homes that have low energy bills","416.2",NA
"and which support our environmental targets","501",NA
"and will expect all new streets to be lined with trees.","501",NA
"Homes for the Future.","H",NA
"We will encourage innovative design and technology to make housing more affordable, accessible, and suitable for disabled people","503",NA
"and an ageing population.","706",NA
"The Green Belt.","H",NA
"We will protect and enhance the Green Belt.","501",NA
"We will improve poor quality land,","501",NA
"increase biodiversity","501",NA
"and make our beautiful countryside more accessible for local community use.","501",NA
"In order to safeguard our green spaces, we will continue to prioritise brownfield development, particularly for the regeneration of our cities and towns.","416.2",NA
"Make Britain the best place to start and grow a business","H",NA
"We want Britain to be the best country in the world to start and grow a business","601.1",NA
"– a place where entrepreneurs know they can build on their ideas and find success.","401",NA
"Not only because businesses are good for society – creating the jobs that put bread on the table","401",NA
", and generating the tax revenue that funds our vital public services.","401",NA
"But because we believe that we should do everything we can to support those who want to start their own company, strike out on their own, and have an idea that grows into a world-leading business.","401",NA
"Our mission as Conservatives is to give everyone across the country the opportunity to fulfil their potential.","401",NA
"We have many strengths.","601.1",NA
"We are a highly competitive economy","401",NA
"with a strong education system","506",NA
"and well-respected regulatory framework.","403",NA
"We have more world-class universities than anywhere in Europe.","601.1",NA
"We are a magnet for talent, and home to more innovative and successful new companies than anywhere on the continent","401",NA
"– especially in the technology sector.","411",NA
"In areas such as tech, financial services, law and the creative industries we lead the world –","411",NA
"and will continue to do so after Brexit.","110",NA
"Of the nearly six million businesses in this country, the vast majority are small and medium sized.","401",NA
"Small and family businesses are the backbone of the economy and Britain is immeasurably stronger for their contribution.","401",NA
"Once we get Brexit done, we can use our new freedoms to ensure that Britain’s businesses can unleash their enormous potential – that they can invest, hire, export and grow,","401",NA
"rather than being crushed by Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell’s inexorable hostility towards aspiration and entrepreneurship.","305.2",NA
"Driving down costs and supporting small businesses","H",NA
"We understand the challenge of increasing running costs, especially for smaller firms, and are committed to reducing them.","402",NA
"Our plan to upgrade infrastructure will make it easier for businesses to operate – to move goods about the country","411",NA
"and to connect to customers around the world via gigabit broadband.","411",NA
"And our new £3 billion National Skills Fund, alongside other major investment in skills and training","411",NA
"and our reforms to high-skilled immigration,","602.2",NA
"will ensure that businesses can find and hire the workers they need.","402",NA
"But we also want to tackle the other everyday obstacles that they face.","402",NA
"We will cut the burden of tax on business by reducing business rates.","402",NA
"This will be done via a fundamental review of the system.","402",NA
"As a first step, we will further reduce business rates for retail businesses,","402",NA
"as well as extending the discount to grassroots music venues,","402",NA
"small cinemas and pubs.","402",NA
"That means protecting your high street and community from excessive tax hikes","402",NA
"and keeping town centres vibrant.","402",NA
"We will increase the Employment Allowance for small businesses – a tax cut for half a million small firms.","402",NA
"We will support start-ups and small businesses via government procurement, and commit to paying them on time.","402",NA
"We will also clamp down on late payment more broadly","403",NA
"and strengthen the powers of the Small Business Commissioner to support small businesses that are exploited by their larger partners.","403",NA
"We will expand start-up loans, which have particularly high take-up from women and BAME entrepreneurs.","503",NA
"The British Business Bank has supported 90,000 smaller businesses with over £7 billion in investment or loans, and will continue to grow.","402",NA
"We will help SMEs to become exporters, so that they can seize the opportunities that will become available once we get Brexit done.","402",NA
"Good regulation is essential to successful businesses:","403",NA
"we will strive to achieve the right regulatory balance between supporting excellent business practice","403",NA
"and protecting workers,","701",NA
"consumers","403",NA
"and the environment.","501",NA
"Through our Red Tape Challenge, we will ensure that regulation is sensible and proportionate,","403",NA
"and that we always consider the needs of small businesses when devising new rules,","403",NA
"using our new freedom after Brexit to ensure that British rules work for British companies.","402",NA
"As well as encouraging investment in physical building and equipment,","411",NA
"we will help employers invest in skills","411",NA
"and look at how we can improve the working of the Apprenticeship Levy.","411",NA
"Backing entrepreneurs and innovation","H",NA
"Every day, people risk their savings and their future by becoming entrepreneurs.","401",NA
"They invent the new goods and services that improve our lives.","401",NA
"From decarbonisation to expanding the frontiers of artificial intelligence, they are tackling some of the great challenges of our time.","401",NA
"We want to be a nation of start-ups, and of successful scale-ups.","401",NA
"We have more ‘unicorns’ – new billion-dollar tech companies – than any other nation in Europe.","401",NA
"We are proud of the work we have done to support entrepreneurship and want to see more entrepreneurs,","402",NA
"including women and those from BAME backgrounds.","503",NA
"Some of our work has been spectacularly successful – such as the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme and Enterprise Investment Scheme, which we will continue in the next Parliament.","402",NA
"And by cutting corporation tax from 28 per cent to 19 per cent, we have encouraged more businesses to invest and grow in the UK.","402",NA
"Some measures have worked, but need to go further – as with R&D tax credits.","402",NA
"We will increase the tax credit rate to 13 per cent","402",NA
"and review the definition of R&D so that important investments in cloud computing and data, which boost productivity and innovation, are also incentivised.","411",NA
"We also have to recognise that some measures haven’t fully delivered on their objectives.","402",NA
"So we will review and reform Entrepreneur’s Relief.","402",NA
"Of course, supporting enterprise is not just about championing businesses – more people than ever are moving into self-employment, especially women.","402",NA
"We will therefore launch a review to explore how we can better support the self-employed.","402",NA
"That includes improving their access to finance and credit (not least mortgages),","402",NA
"making the tax system easier to navigate,","402",NA
"and examining how better broadband can boost home-working.","411",NA
"Building a fairer taxation system","H",NA
"Conservatives believe in a corporate tax system which rewards entrepreneurship","402",NA
"and punishes evasion.","403",NA
"We will always be whole-heartedly on the side of business,","402",NA
"while making sure everyone pays their fair share of tax.","403",NA
"Already, the top 1 per cent of income taxpayers pay over 29 per cent of income tax– higher than at any time under the last Labour Government.","403",NA
"We will continue to build on this to tackle tax evasion","403",NA
"and reduce opportunities for aggressive tax avoidance.","403",NA
"Since 2010, we have introduced more than 100 anti-avoidance measures","403",NA
"and secured more than £200 billion which would otherwise have gone unpaid – £24 billion in the last year alone.","403",NA
"We have led the international fight against aggressive tax avoidance and offshore tax havens, rewriting global rules to ensure tax is paid where profit is made.","403",NA
"This has included committing 100 jurisdictions to ending bank secrecy.","403",NA
"But we can go further still.","403",NA
"The gap between the amount of tax that should be paid and is actually collected stands at £35 billion – still too high.","403",NA
"Hard-working families and businesses who do pay their fair share should know that we will not permit evasion to go unchecked.","403",NA
"So we will set out a new anti-tax avoidance and evasion law.","403",NA
"This will: Double the maximum prison term to 14 years for individuals convicted of the most egregious examples of tax fraud.","605.1",NA
"Create a single, beefed-up Anti-Tax Evasion unit in HMRC that covers all duties and taxes, from individual errors to deliberate non-compliance – which is put on a legislative footing.","403",NA
"Consolidate existing anti-evasion and avoidance measures and powers.","403",NA
"Introduce a new package of anti-evasion measures, including measures to end tax abuse in the construction sector,","403",NA
"crack down on illicit tobacco packaging","403",NA
"and further measures to avoid profit-shifting by multinational companies to avoid paying taxes.","403",NA
"Major multinational companies should pay their fair share of tax.","403",NA
"As part of our approach, we will implement the Digital Services Tax.","403",NA
"While always backing entrepreneurs that choose to make the UK the place to invest and set up a business,","401",NA
"we will take further action to redesign the tax system so that it boosts growth,","403",NA
"wages and investment","701",NA
"and limits arbitrary tax advantages for the wealthiest in society.","503",NA
"We are also strengthening the UK’s corporate governance regime, and will reform insolvency rules and the audit regime so that customers and suppliers – and UK taxpayers – are better protected when firms like Thomas Cook go into administration.","403",NA
"We will also carefully study the results of the ongoing investigation into its collapse.","403",NA
"We will improve incentives to attack the problem of excessive executive pay and rewards for failure.","403",NA
"We will reintroduce legislation that protects pension pots from being plundered by reckless bosses,","403",NA
"helps savers be better informed with pension dashboards,","403",NA
"and creates a new style of pension scheme which is more sustainable for workers and employers.","701",NA
"Invest in Britain’s people","H",NA
"The 2020s will see a transformation in jobs.","701",NA
"Automation and computing will change how businesses function.","411",NA
"Our plan to deliver clean energy and a carbon-neutral future means new kinds of jobs in new industries.","416.2",NA
"And our departure from the European Union means we can develop forward-looking regulations to ensure we are first in line to develop and benefit from the technologies of the future.","110",NA
"This requires a dramatic rebooting of our training system","411",NA
"– to support public services,","504",NA
"existing businesses and the businesses of the future.","402",NA
"But above all, we want to ensure that Britain’s workers have the skills they need to flourish","701",NA
"– and that every citizen of this country has the opportunity to express their talents to the fullest.","606.1",NA
"Levelling up Britain’s skills","H",NA
"Since 2010, the Government has invested significantly in technical qualifications and apprenticeships, with 3.8 million more apprenticeships.","411",NA
"In the next Parliament, we expect to train up hundreds of thousands more highly skilled apprentices.","411",NA
"But we will go further and require significant numbers of new UK apprentices for all big new infrastructure projects – new hospitals, new schools, major transport projects and so on,","411",NA
"being built with pride by a new generation of British workers.","601.1",NA
"Whatever age you are, nothing is more Conservative than working hard to improve your lot","505",NA
"and nothing is more important for the Conservative Party than supporting people in those efforts.","701",NA
"Our reforms and investment in education and skills mean more children are leaving school better equipped for working life","411",NA
"and there are more high quality apprenticeships.","411",NA
"But there is much more to do to level up the skills of the entire nation.","411",NA
"Not just to improve Britain’s productivity,","410",NA
"but to enable people to fulfil their potential.","701",NA
"As the centrepiece of our plan, we will create a new National Skills Fund worth £3 billion over the next Parliament.","411",NA
"This fund will provide matching funding for individuals and SMEs for high-quality education and training.","411",NA
"A proportion will be reserved for further strategic investment in skills, and we will consult widely on the overall design.","411",NA
"The National Skills Fund will help to transform the lives of people who have not got onto the work ladder and lack qualifications,","411",NA
"as well as people who are keen to return to work from, say, raising a family, or switch from one career to another.","701",NA
"It will not only make this country more prosperous, but fairer.","601.1",NA
"Just as universities have been transformed by significant long-term investment over the last few decades, we need to make sure local colleges are equally excellent places for people to learn.","506",NA
"We are therefore investing almost £2 billion to upgrade the entire further education college estate.","506",NA
"And we’ll also have 20 Institutes of Technology, which connect high-quality teaching in science, technology, engineering and maths to business and industry.","411",NA
"Vitally, leaving the EU also means that we can take back control of the money that was being channelled via its Structural Funds.","110",NA
"We have already announced a UK Shared Prosperity Fund, to ensure that the people of the UK do not lose out from the withdrawal of EU funding","503",NA
"(which was, of course, only a small part of the billions of pounds we were contributing),","110",NA
"and to replace the EU programme with one that is fairer and better tailored to our economy.","110",NA
"And we will ensure that £500 million of the UK Shared Prosperity Fund is used to give disadvantaged people the skills they need to make a success of life.","503",NA
"Taken together, this package of measures represents a profound commitment to Britain’s future –","601.1",NA
"to helping people of whatever age and background navigate the new world of work,","701",NA
"equip themselves with the skills they need,","411",NA
"increase their earnings","701",NA
"and Britain more productive.","410",NA
"World-leading universities","H",NA
"The UK is home to leading universities, which attract students from all over the world, conduct vital research, and generate enormous benefits for our economy and our society.","601.1",NA
"They also do an excellent job of generating many of the skills that our economy needs, producing globally renowned scientists, entrepreneurs and creators, and enabling millions of people to fulfil their potential.","401",NA
"In the next Parliament we will work to maintain and strengthen our global position in higher education.","401",NA
"The Augar Review made thoughtful recommendations on tuition fee levels, the balance of funding between universities, further education and apprenticeships and adult learning, and we will consider them carefully.","403",NA
"We will look at the interest rates on loan repayments with a view to reducing the burden of debt on students.","403",NA
"We also will continue to explore ways to tackle the problem of grade inflation and low quality courses,","403",NA
"and improve the application and offer system for undergraduate students.","503",NA
"Our approach will be underpinned by a commitment to fairness, quality of learning and teaching, and access.","403",NA
"We will also strengthen academic freedom and free speech in universities","201.2",NA
"and continue to focus on raising standards.","403",NA
"We will strengthen universities and colleges’ civic role.","606.1",NA
"We will invest in local adult education and require the Office for Students to look at universities’ success in increasing access across all ages, not just young people entering full-time undergraduate degrees.","403",NA
"Fairness in the workplace","H",NA
"As well as making Britain the best place to start a business,","402",NA
"and the best place to learn and develop your skills,","411",NA
"we want to make the UK the best place in the world to work.","701",NA
"The increase in employment that the Conservative Government has overseen since 2010 is proof that there is no contradiction between high employment and high standards","701",NA
"– between dynamic growth and protecting employees from unfair policies and discriminatory treatment.","701",NA
"Over the last year, for example, unemployment has continued to fall,","701",NA
"even as average real wages have increased.","701",NA
"We have raised the personal income tax allowance,","401",NA
"increased the minimum wage","412",NA
"and introduced and consistently raised the National Living Wage to ensure that people get to keep more of what they earn","401",NA
"and that work always pays.","701",NA
"And we have aimed to strike the right balance between the flexibility that the economy needs and the security that employees deserve,","403",NA
"introducing new protections for workers","701",NA
"while preserving the dynamism and job creation that drive our shared prosperity.","403",NA
"Once we have got Brexit done, we will go further.","701",NA
"Because people cannot fulfil their potential if they do not have jobs that treat them with dignity and respect,","701",NA
"and if they are not in control of their lives and their futures.","701",NA
"As Conservatives we will always prioritise the principle of fairness in the workplace, whether it is in the job application process,","701",NA
"ensuring equal pay for equal work,","701",NA
"or people’s working conditions.","701",NA
"We scrapped exclusivity clauses in zero hours contracts to give workers more flexibility.","701",NA
"We have already taken forward a number of recommendations from the Taylor Review and will build on existing employment law with measures that protect those in low-paid work and the gig economy.","701",NA
"For example: We will create a single enforcement body and crack down on any employer abusing employment law, whether by taking workers’ tips or refusing them sick pay.","701",NA
"We will ensure that workers have the right to request a more predictable contract and other reasonable protections.","701",NA
"We also want to look at more radical ways to support working families in the UK.","701",NA
"Our lifestyles have been transformed over the last four decades – many families today have two working parents who are juggling work and other responsibilities.","701",NA
"They have to stretch themselves daily to care for children, elderly relatives and those with disabilities.","701",NA
"For women, who still tend to be the main carers in households, this can have a big impact on their careers and limit their participation in the workplace.","701",NA
"But while the modern workplace is adapting as a result, we can do more as a Government to make things easier, learning from sensible approaches adopted in other countries.","701",NA
"We will therefore introduce a raft of measures that balance the needs of employees and employers:","403",NA
"We will encourage flexible working and consult on making it the default unless employers have good reasons not to.","701",NA
"We have reformed redundancy law so companies cannot discriminate against women immediately after returning from maternity leave.","701",NA
"We will legislate to allow parents to take extended leave for neonatal care, to support those new mothers and fathers who need it during the most vulnerable and stressful days of their lives.","701",NA
"And we will look at ways to make it easier for fathers to take paternity leave.","701",NA
"We will extend the entitlement to leave for unpaid carers, the majority of whom are women, to a week.","505",NA
"Over the last nine years, we have extended the offer of free childcare hours to more working parents.","504",NA
"We know that people value this support, but wish it could be more flexible.","701",NA
"As outlined above, we will fund more high-quality childcare before and after school and during the holidays","504",NA
"so that working parents do not have to choose between their careers and their children.","701",NA
"Our vision for the labour market, in other words, is not one where the state does everything for you.","401",NA
"It is one where the state does everything it can to help you help yourself – by upgrading your skills,","411",NA
"or by being able to balance work and family life.","701",NA
"It is one in which a deep commitment to entrepreneurship and business is matched","401",NA
"by a desire to ensure that the jobs that are created are highly skilled, well-paid and fulfilling.","701",NA
"Unleash innovation","H",NA
"The UK has a proud record of innovation and discovery.","601.1",NA
"We are the country that gave the world penicillin, the World Wide Web, the theories of gravity and evolution, that unravelled the structure of DNA.","601.1",NA
"The University of Cambridge alone has played host to more Nobel laureates than have been produced by any country in the world bar the United States.","601.1",NA
"More, indeed, than France, Japanand China – combined.","601.1",NA
"That spirit of discovery is still alive in this country today.","601.1",NA
"But we have not always turned our genius for innovation into jobs and companies here in Britain.","401",NA
"EU regulations have been another barrier to innovation.","110",NA
"We need to use science and research to unite and level up our country, giving people opportunity and hope.","411",NA
"Once we have got Brexit done, we will turn our attention to the great challenges of the future such as clean energy and advanced energy storage;","501",NA
