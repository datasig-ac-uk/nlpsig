"Follow theSNP",NA,NA
"My vow is to make Scotland stronger at Westminster. At this election, we have the opportunity to shake up the out of touch Westminster system so that it serves Scotland better. A vote for the SNP on May 7th is a vote for MPs who will always stand up for Scotland's best interests. It is a vote to make Scotland's voice heard at Westminster more loudly than it has ever been heard before. And it is a vote for more progressive politics. The SNP will use our influence at Westminster to help deliver positive change for the benefit of ordinary people, not just in Scotland, but across the UK. We propose a real alternative to the pain of austerity, an end to unfair policies like the Bedroom Tax, a higher minimum wage and protection for our NHS and vital public services. Instead of even deeper Westminster spending cuts, we want to see more investment in our economy, to create more and better paid jobs. And we want the precious resources of our country to be invested in building a better future for our children, not on a new generation of nuclear weapons.The SNP will never put the Tories into power.Instead, if there is an antiTory majority after the election, we will offer to work with other parties to keep the Tories out.And we will then use our influence to demand that Labour delivers the real change that people want and need instead of just being a carbon copy of the Tories.A vote for the SNP will make Scotland's voice heard loudly and clearly.And it will help deliver new, better and more progressive politics at Westminster for everyone.My vow is to make Scotland stronger at Westminster. With your support, we can secure a better future for you, your family and Scotland.",NA,NA

"Here are our key priorities to make Scotland stronger at Westminster:","301",NA
"An end to austerity",NA,NA
"SNP  MPs  will  demand  an  end  to  austerity.","409",NA
"We  oppose  further spending  cuts  and  propose  modest  spending  increases   of  0.5  per  cent  above  inflation   in  each  year  of  the  next  Parliament.","409",NA
"Under our plan, the deficit will still reduce each year,","414",NA
"but there will be at least an additional £140 billion across the UK to invest in skills and infrastructure,","411",NA
"in our NHS and other public services,","504",NA
"and in measures to protect the vulnerable and lift people out of poverty.","503",NA
"We will also vote for the following revenue raising measures the reintroduction of the 50 pence top tax rate,","409",NA
"a tax on bankers' bonuses,","409",NA
"a bank levy,","409",NA
"a mansion tax,","409",NA
"a crackdown on tax avoidance,","605",NA
"the abolition of 'nondom' status","409",NA
"and reversal of the married couple’s tax allowance.","503",NA
"Increased NHS funding",NA,NA
"We will meet the NHS funding challenge laid down in the report of the NHS Chief Executive in England – the Stevens Report and vote for an increase in NHS spending across the UK of £24 billion by 202021 £9.5 billion above inflation.","504",NA
"This will deliver a total boost to the NHS Scotland budget of £2 billion by 202021.","504",NA
"SNP MPs will also vote against any further privatisation of the NHS in England and back any moves to restore it to a fully public service.","413",NA
"Fairer pensions",NA,NA
"We will support a singletier pension of £160 per week","504",NA
"and vote to continue the triple lock, guaranteeing that pensions will always rise by inflation, earnings or 2.5 per cent whichever is the highest.","504",NA
"We will also vote to protect the Winter Fuel Allowance.","504",NA
"We will oppose the abolition of Savings Credit – introduced to reward people for saving for their pension","504",NA
"and we will seek a review of plans to increase the state pension age beyond 66.","504",NA
"Scrapping Trident",NA,NA
"We will oppose plans for a new generation of Trident nuclear weapons","105",NA
"and seek to build an alliance in the House of Commons against Trident renewal.","105",NA

"Better paid jobs",NA,NA
"We will vote to increase the minimum wage to £8.70 by 2020.","412",NA
"We will also support measures to extend the Living Wage across the UK.","412",NA
"The Scottish Government already pays the Living Wage to all of its own employees and to those covered by its pay policy we will call on,","412",NA
"and vote for, the UK government to adopt the same policy.","412",NA
"Reducing child poverty",NA,NA
"It is estimated that an additional one million children across the UK will be living in poverty by 2020.","504",NA
"That is unacceptable and would mean an additional 100,000 children in Scotland growing up in poverty.","504",NA
"That is why we will vigorously oppose plans for further cuts in Child Benefit and Tax Credits allowing these payments to erode in value simply pushes more children into poverty.","504",NA
"Instead, we will vote to increase benefits at least in line with CPI inflation//,","504",NA
"to ensure that the incomes of the poorest in society do not fall even further behind the cost of living.","503",NA

"These cuts would see more than 100,000 disabled people in Scotland – and one million across the UK – losing over £1,100 a year in the support that they rely on to live independent lives.","503",NA

"Scrapping the Bedroom Tax",NA,NA
"We will vote for the immediate abolition of the unfair Bedroom Tax.","503",NA
"Abolishing the Bedroom Tax would mean that the £35 million a year that the Scottish Government is spending to compensate those affected by it would be available to spend on other priorities.","503",NA
"We would invest that money in measures to tackle and eventually eradicate food poverty.","503",NA
"Investing in education",NA,NA

"Immigration policy that works for Scotland",NA,NA
"Diversity is one of Scotland's great strengths.","607",NA

"but we must also remember that those who have come to Scotland from other countries make a significant contribution to our economy and our society.","607",NA
"We will support sensible immigration policies that meet our economic needs","403",NA

"More affordable housing",NA,NA
"There is a substantial shortfall of affordable houses for rent across the UK.","503",NA
"The Scottish Government is on track to meet the commitment to 30,000 new affordable homes by 2016, but more needs to be done.","503",NA

"Fair work",NA,NA
"In work poverty is a modern day scandal that must be tackled.","503",NA
"We support increases in the personal tax allowance","503",NA
"but will also back an increase in the Work Allowance – the amount people are allowed to earn before their benefit is cut – of 20 per cent.","701",NA

"Westminster badly needs to be reformed.","202",NA
"An unelected second chamber is not acceptable in a modern democracy.","202",NA

"We will also vote for the replacement of the first past the post voting system with proportional representation.","202",NA

"The SNP will always support independence but that is not what this election is about.","602",NA

"We believe that these proposals do not go far enough to honour the promises made during the referendum.","602",NA
"We will seek agreement that the Scottish Parliament should move to full financial responsibility.","301",NA
"As implementation of the Calman Commission proposals has demonstrated, the transition to full fiscal responsibility and agreement of the detailed fiscal framework that would underpin it would take a number of years.","301",NA
"SNP MPs will work to secure the best deal for Scotland.","301",NA

"We believe in independence but that is not what this election is about.","602",NA
"A vote for the SNP is a vote to rebalance the economic and political priorities of the UK.","301",NA

"An approach to the public finances that works",NA,NA
"The starting point for the next parliament and government must be an approach to the public finances that works.","414",NA
"There can be no doubt, based on the Office for Budget Responsibility’s figures and the targets set by the current government itself, that George Osborne’s approach has failed on multiple counts, with borrowing rising substantially.","414",NA
"Indeed, net borrowing in this financial year has exceeded the June 2010 forecast by around £50 billion.","414",NA
"This is due, in large part, to a crucial weakness in the economic recovery, in particular lower than anticipated tax revenues in an economy that has become low wage and low reward for too many.","414",NA
"At the same time, taxes have been cut for those at the very top of the income scale.","414",NA
"It is clear that a different way of doing things is needed one that places greater emphasis on economic growth","410",NA
"and social solidarity,","503",NA
"with a realistic target to reduce government debt to a prudent level","414",NA
"and to maintain a balanced budget on average over the medium term.","414",NA
"We need a proper fiscal framework based on proven principles that have been successfully implemented elsewhere.","414",NA
"This includes a commitment to reduce overall government debt and move to a position of operating budget surpluses over the medium term.","414",NA
"In addition, we believe fiscally responsible governments should establish a financial buffer against unforeseen future events.","414",NA
"We reject the current trajectory of spending, proposed by the UK government and the limited alternative proposed by the Labour Party.","409",NA
"Our proposal would see public sector borrowing and public sector net debt falling in every year as a share of national income.","414",NA
"In total, over £140 billion of additional public expenditure and investment would be available during the next parliament, compared to current UK government plans.","409",NA
"We will also look to release additional resources by backing a series of revenue raising measures the reintroduction of the 50p top tax rate, a tax on bankers' bonuses, a bank levy,   a mansion tax, a crackdown on tax avoidance, the abolition of 'non dom' status, reversal of the married couples' tax allowance, and a review of the pension tax relief available to the wealthiest.","409",NA
"A greater focus on job creation and growth",NA,NA
"We need increased investment in economic growth","410",NA
"and action to get more people into rewarding, sustainable, wellpaid employment.","701",NA
"As set out above, we propose modest spending increases to invest in the economy, enabling us to deliver a stronger fiscal performance over the mediumterm.","409",NA
"A stronger economy is the essential underpinning for deficit reduction in the UK, with higher levels of growth delivering increased revenues and reducing spending pressures.","409",NA
"More broadly, improvements to productivity would translate into big medium and longterm improvements in the UK’s fiscal position.","409",NA
"We believe that this should be a central focus for government policy over the next 5 years.","404",NA
"The key is to both protect and promote key sectors of the Scottish economy.","404",NA
"The UK government has agreed to implement the key proposals put forward by the Scottish Government and the oil and gas industry.","404",NA
"This is a welcome step, however, we will continue to closely monitor economic activity in the North Sea and look for a prompt and effective response from the UK government so we can maximise the economic opportunity.","404",NA
"Action by the UK government was a necessary first step and will sit alongside the Scottish Government’s commitment to a new Oil and Gas Strategy, which will have a strong focus on Scotland’s oil and gas supply chain,","404",NA
"including ongoing skills development and opportunities for greater internationalisation of the sector.","404",NA
"We will also continue to push for the swift deployment of the new Oil and Gas Authority in Aberdeen.","301",NA
"There are a number of additional steps we believe should be taken by the UK government, while they continue to hold the reserved responsibility, to boost Scotland’s economic performance.","404",NA
"This includes additional capital investment to support sustainable and broadbased economic recovery","404",NA
"and make the country as a whole more internationally competitive.","404",NA
"The more economic powers we have the more we can achieve",NA,NA
"Despite having limited powers, we have taken action to boost our economy and support employment.","402",NA
"For example, at the height of the financial crisis, we were able to accelerate capital investment in ‘shovel ready’ projects","402",NA
"and could also take forward a range of innovative financing mechanisms and get better value for money through the Scottish Futures Trust,","402",NA
"meaning more money was available for frontline, job creation projects.","402",NA
"In addition, our specific focus on youth employment, with guarantees on access to education and training and a massive expansion of Modern Apprenticeship places,","411",NA
"and our support for small businesses with an extensive rates relief package (helping many survive the worst of the crisis)","402",NA
"have made a difference for thousands of people across Scotland.","503",NA
"We’ve also made sure people have more money in their pockets, with the Council Tax frozen, real terms cuts in water bills and policies like free prescriptions providing a welcome boost for family incomes.","503",NA
"Thanks to this approach, more money is available to spend in local economies.","409",NA
"As a result, we have reduced unemployment, increased employment in Scotland and have a stronger record on youth employment than the UK.","701",NA
"Investing in infrastructure",NA,NA
"We firmly believe that additional investment in Scotland’s infrastructure, and that of the rest of the UK, is an important part of building the wider strength of our economy and society.","411",NA
"Our proposals for additional expenditure in the next Parliament will include substantial new infrastructure investment.","411",NA
"Properly deployed, capital expenditure has the ability to reduce inequalities by providing good, well paid employment, with opportunities for the longterm unemployed, for apprenticeships and for wider skills and professional development.","503",NA
"It also serves to expand the productive capacity of Scotland, making our economy more competitive, with improved connectivity and infrastructure that is fit for the 21st century.","411",NA
"The additional investment we seek should include investment in our energy infrastructure so we can continue to maximise renewables generation, in particular offshore.","411",NA
"Current Westminster plans put at risk the creation of a strong domestic renewables industry, including a sustainable supply chain, and threaten Scotland’s security of supply.","416",NA
"We will, for example, press for further progress and a clear timescale for the delivery of the islands interconnector and reform of the transmission charging regime which could lead to the premature closure of Longannet power station.","411",NA
"We will also support steps to increase the capital available to the Green Investment Bank","416",NA
"and will ask the next UK government to report on options including new borrowing powers for the bank.","416",NA
"We will also seek adequate transport infrastructure investment, with a particular aim of improving transport and communication links across the north of these isles.","411",NA
"That includes connecting Scotland to HS2 as a priority, with construction beginning in Scotland as well as England,","411",NA
"and a high speed connection between Glasgow, Edinburgh and the north of England as part of any highspeed rail network.","411",NA
"In addition, we will seek additional investment to support a more rapid roll out of superfast broadband and 4G across Scotland","411",NA
"and to support wider and affordable access to the internet in our most disadvantaged communities,","411",NA
"and for a Universal Service Obligation to be applied to telecoms and broadband providers ensuring everyone is able to access the communications they need.","411",NA
"We will back investment a housebuilding target across the UK of 100,000 affordable homes per year.","503",NA
"We are determined to use capital investment to create jobs,","701",NA
"and support higher levels of economic growth.","410",NA
"This additional investment would support at least 6,500 jobs in the construction sector in Scotland.","701",NA
"Supporting Scotland’s job creating businesses",NA,NA
"We want to make it much easier for growing businesses across Scotland to access finance and will look for an expansion of lending options, including peertopeer lending and making it easier for new entrants to the market, in particular to help with short term financing.","402",NA
"We believe the UK government should be doing more to rebalance economic activity on these isles","301",NA
"and so we will press for seedfund capitalisation of the new Scottish Business Development Bank, enabling new finance and investment for Scottish business to maximise job creation and growth.","402",NA
"We support calls for more readily available export finance and believe the steps outlined in the Scottish Government’s updated Economic Strategy, with its focus on internationalisation, will boost export opportunities for Scottish businesses and help increase the number of Scottish exporters.","402",NA
"We also believe that more should be done to help small businesses with cash flow and will press the UK government to introduce effective legal protections to ensure small businesses are paid on time.","402",NA
"We agree that small businesses should have rights within key utility markets more akin to those of household consumers.","403",NA
"For our tourism sector, we will press for the early devolution of Air Passenger Duty (APD) so we can use this new power to encourage more direct flights to Scotland,","402",NA
"with a reduction of 50 per cent and longer term plans to abolish APD completely.","402",NA
"We will also support examining a reduction in VAT for the hospitality sector,","402",NA
"levelling the playing field with other EU nations","403",NA
"and helping create as many as 10,000 new jobs.","701",NA
"For our creative industries, we will press for the BBC in Scotland to receive a fairer share of licence fee revenue generated in Scotland, which would bring a £100 million boost to Scotland’s creative sector.","502",NA
"We support the creation of a Creative Content Fund for the games industry to encourage the formation of new studios","502",NA
"and also back the retention of the Video Games tax relief.","502",NA
"We back industry calls for an increase in the SEIS investment limit and changes to the Shortage Occupation List to recognise specific skills needs in the sector.","502",NA
"Scotland needs an immigration policy suited to our specific circumstances and needs.","408",NA
"In particular, we wish to see the reintroduction of the poststudy work visa so students who have been educated in Scotland can spend 2 years working here after their studies and can contribute to growing our economy.","410",NA
"We will examine proposals to maintain the Annual Investment Allowance at a stable rate and consider whether it can be maintained at £500,000 and whether it can be extended until the end of the next Parliament in 2020.","402",NA
"This allowance supports investment in plant, machinery and premises and we believe business deserves certainty to enable them to make longerterm investment decisions.","402",NA
"We will also support a phased increase in the Employment Allowance from £2,000 per business per year to £6,000 per business per year by 201920.","402",NA
"This will provide a boost to employment growth by reducing the cost of creating and maintaining jobs.","402",NA
"This proposal will particularly benefit smaller businesses with over 95% of the support going to smaller firms.","402",NA
"Getting more people into wellpaid and rewarding work",NA,NA
"The SNP will use its influence at Westminster to deliver key economic advantages for Scotland.","301",NA
"Our proposals include: An increase in the minimum wage to £8.70by 2020.","412",NA
"Easier access to finance for growing Scottish companies through the Scottish Business Development Bank","402",NA
"A boost for Scotland’s tourism and hospitality sectors with plans for a reduction in Air Passenger Duty","402",NA
"More spending in local economies with an increased minimum wage and lower National Insurance costs for companies to help create jobs","402",NA
"A £100 million investment in jobs in the creative sector with BBC Scotland receiving a fairer share of the licence fee.","502",NA
"Increased investment in infrastructure as part of our alternative to the failed UK austerity agenda","411",NA
"We believe that public sector organisations should be able to bid to operate rail services,","413",NA
"as allowed in EU law but currently prevented by UK legislation.","108",NA
"This would enable us to ensure the delivery of rail services in Scotland that deliver maximum economic and social benefit.","413",NA
"A government that works for all the country",NA,NA
"One of the greatest indictments of the current Westminster system is that it works best for one part of society and one part of the country.","602",NA
"Social and geographic imbalances are increasing at a worrying rate, with an increasing imbalance between London, and the southeast, and the rest of the UK.","301",NA
"SNP MPs will seek to rebalance the UK for the benefit of people in the north and west of these isles.","301",NA
"We believe that investment in so called “national” projects in London, should be subject to normal consequential funding for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland","301",NA
"and that the North of England, in particular, should see a significant increase in infrastructure expenditure.","411",NA
"Alongside the development of High Speed Rail from London to the Midlands,","411",NA
"we will seek a commitment to deliver High Speed Rail between Glasgow, Edinburgh and the north of England as the first stage of a link connecting Scotland and the north of England to London.","411",NA
"High Speed Rail should be constructed both from the north down and from the south up.","411",NA
"We will support Scotland’s city authorities with proposals for new City Deals – like the one already agreed with Glasgow and Clyde Valley – and will seek the creation of a £300 million Scottish Cities Fund, and similar Northern Cities and Welsh Cities funds, to ensure adequate resources are available to support the growth of major urban centres in the north and west of the UK.","301",NA
"While a strong London is good for the UK, also having a strong Glasgow, Aberdeen, Inverness, Cardiff, Newcastle and Leeds is even better.","301",NA
"The SNP will also aim to right a longterm economic injustice, by ensuring that a share of future oil and gas and renewable energy revenues are used to create a Sovereign Wealth Fund.","404",NA
"The current UK government has conceded the principle by proposing a natural resource fund for the benefit of the North of England.","404",NA
"The fund should be established when economic circumstances allow and should come under the ownership and management of the Scottish Parliament and Government.","404",NA
"We will look to boost Scotland’s rural economy by pressing for a fair share of the UK’s CAP convergence uplift, which comes to the UK as a result of Scotland’s low hectare rates.","703",NA
"The rural economy",NA,NA
"The Scottish Government has prioritised Scotland’s rural economy and is working to strengthen our rural and remote communities.","703",NA
"This includes measures such as Road Equivalent Tariff,","703",NA
"a focus on the promotion of our food and drink sector","703",NA
"and key infrastructure investment such as the dualling of the A9.","411",NA
"At Westminster, SNP MPs will seek the same level of commitment to our rural industries and communities.","703",NA
"In particular, we will scrutinise UK government actions at an EU level to ensure that our farming and fishing industries receive full backing and support.","703",NA
"Other measures, proposed in this manifesto, that will be of particular benefit to our rural economy and rural communities are:","703",NA
"Protection of the Royal Mail’s Universal Service Obligation,","703",NA
"the maintenance of the 30 per cent government share of Royal Mail in order to protect the public interest","413",NA
"and, over time, the return of the Royal Mail to public ownership.","413",NA
"The introduction of a Universal Service Obligation for broadband services","411",NA

"Taking forward Scotland’s £1.3 billion rural development programme","703",NA

"A FAIRER SOCIETY An economy that works for the many",NA,NA
"We will firmly oppose, and seek to reverse, the growing inequality in UK society","503",NA
"– inequality that acts as a dampener on growth and limits opportunity for people in communities across the country.","503",NA
"That is why we must create a fair wage economy,","403",NA
"with higher wages for those on low and middle earnings translating into increased revenues for the Exchequer.","403",NA
"Underpinning this is our belief that everyone should have the opportunity of a good life in return for their effort and hard work.","403",NA
"Increasing the minimum wage and expanding the living wage will help deliver both a strong economy and a fairer society.","403",NA
"Instead of the current, failed Westminster approach, which is based on the false belief that the fruits of economic growth ‘trickle down’, we believe that increasing the incomes of those lower down the income scale will deliver a more direct benefit for our economy, as well as improving quality of life for hardpressed households.","403",NA
"This alternative approach sees all our citizens as valued contributors to society,","503",NA
"with the impact of higher disposable incomes felt most significantly in local economies and our thousands of small and medium sized businesses, as well as in higher revenues.","403",NA
"We also propose different spending and taxation priorities.","403",NA
"At a time when thousands of our citizens are forced to use food banks, there can be no doubt that spending billions on a new generation of nuclear weapons is unjustifiable.","105",NA
"A vote for the SNP is a vote to halt progress on Trident renewal, delivering a saving of £100 billion over the next 35 years.","105",NA
"Alongside this, we will back proposals to return the top rate of income tax in the UK to 50p.","403",NA
"We support a levy on tobacco firms","403",NA
"and would also support proposals for a specific tax on properties valued at over £2 million,","403",NA
"increases to the bank levy,","403",NA
"a banker’s bonus tax","403",NA
"and a review of the pension tax relief available to the wealthiest.","403",NA
"We would also call on the UK government to move forward cautiously with plans to increase the higher rate threshold to £50,000, ensuring first that tax revenues are sufficiently buoyant.","403",NA
"We will look to ensure the public interest is fully protected in any future disposal of RBS and Lloyds shares, including decisions on how any windfall revenues should be used.","403",NA
"A tax system that works better",NA,NA
"It’s clear that action needs to be taken to ensure we have a tax system that is fit for the 21st century.","303",NA
"We will back measures to tackle tax avoidance, including early legislation to address tax dodging and an increase in staff resources at HMRC.","303",NA
"We will put forward measures to strengthen antiavoidance law across the UK to ensure it is as strong as new Scottish legislation.","605",NA
"We will also support a review of controlled foreign companies exemptions","403",NA
"and favour a rolling review of tax reliefs as part of an ongoing programme of simplification of the tax system.","303",NA
"We support calls for a global fair tax summit to agree international measures to tackle tax abuses.","403",NA
"More support for hardpressed households",NA,NA
"Using the current powers of devolution, the SNP Scottish Government has taken forward policies designed to support households through the recession.","403",NA
"For example, we have frozen the Council Tax,","403",NA
"removed prescription charges","504",NA
"and road tolls,","403",NA
"increased free nursery provision,","504",NA
"provided free school meals in the early years of primary school","504",NA
"and reintroduced free university education.","506",NA
"Taken together, these measures have saved people across Scotland hundreds of pounds.","403",NA
"That includes pensioners saving an average £250 a year from concessionary travel or people with long term illnesses an average of £104 on prescription charges.","403",NA
"A vote for the SNP in May is a vote to protect these gains.","403",NA
"As well as certainty on Council Tax bills, we have also placed limits on increases in rail fares and water charges.","403",NA
"Through tough and effective regulation of Scottish Water we’ve been able to deliver realterms cuts in water bills.","403",NA
"In the same way we wish to see a more robust approach to energy bills and believe Ofgem should be empowered to enforce price reductions to reflect lower wholesale costs as a result of lower oil prices.","403",NA
"Consumers must see the benefit of lower wholesale costs in their bills, with savings of as much as £100 a year.","403",NA
"The Scottish Government and UK government should have joint oversight of Ofgem.","403",NA
"A fair deal for older Scots",NA,NA
"We will continue to support older Scots, by retaining key policies such as the free bus pass and free personal care and we’ll back the continuation of the free TV license.","504",NA
"At Westminster, we will call for the pension triple lock to be retained, ensuring the State Pension increases each year in line with inflation, wages or by 2.5 per cent, whichever is higher.","504",NA
"And, we will support for a Single Tier Pension rate of £160 per week.","504",NA
"We will oppose the abolition of Savings Credit – introduced to reward people for saving for their pension.","504",NA
"We believe that there should be a review of plans to increase the state pension age beyond 66.","504",NA
"And, given Scotland’s colder climate, we will also resist any attempts to end the winter fuel allowance.","504",NA
"We will continue to support the roll out of auto enrolment for occupational pensions and also back, in principle, proposals to give pensioners more flexibility over their pension pots.","504",NA
"However, we must ensure adequate levels of advice and support.","504",NA
"We will work with pensioner groups to identify and target unfair, hidden pension charges.","504",NA
"Fairness in the welfare system",NA,NA
"Westminster has presided over a relentless undermining of our social security system.","504",NA
"The SNP is determined to target the worst and most damaging welfare changes introduced by the current government","504",NA
"and to address issues such as zerohour contracts, which create unacceptable levels of uncertainty and financial insecurity for often low paid workers.","403",NA
"We will support efforts in the next parliament to end unfair and exploitative zerohour contracts,","403",NA
"with a timelimited consultation, which fully involves businesses and the trade unions, to agree the most effective way forward.","405",NA
"SNP MPs will vote for the complete abolition of the bedroom tax.","504",NA
"This will mean that the £35 million that the Scottish Government spends on mitigating its impact will be available for other purposes.","504",NA
"We would invest that money to tackle and eventually eradicate food poverty.","504",NA
"We also back increases of at least the cost of living in welfare benefits and believe the roll out of both Personal Independence Payments (PIP) and Universal Credit should be halted.","504",NA
"We will aim to reverse the replacement of Disability Living Allowance with PIP.","504",NA
"We will also oppose the £3 billion cut in disability support.","504",NA
"In addition, we have given assurances to people already supported by the Independent Living Fund that support will continue.","504",NA
"We will also support an urgent review of the system of assessments for disability benefits.","504",NA
"The current tapers for Universal Credit have been set too low, which means claimants will still be caught in the benefits trap, with clear financial disincentives in place for work.","504",NA
"We believe there should be an increase in the work allowance, to deliver a significant boost to the incomes of people moving into work, helping to lift them and their families out of poverty.","504",NA
"We will also support an overhaul of the Work Capability Assessments.","504",NA
"These are still delivering too many poor decisions, which are overturned on appeal, creating real hardship for households.","504",NA
"We will demand an urgent review of the conditionality and sanctions regime, in order to deliver an overhaul of the current, deeply ineffective arrangements, which impact on some of the most vulnerable in our society.","504",NA
"The review will take particular account of the needs of people with mental health issues.","504",NA
"We will seek to establish an approach that is proportionate and ethical, that recognises the particular challenges facing some individuals, and that avoids excessive or blanket measures which penalise those looking for work.","504",NA
"The removal of cash benefits should be a last, rather than a first, resort.","504",NA
"We will support an increase in Carers' Allowance so that it matches Jobseekers' Allowance.","504",NA
"Those in receipt of Carers' Allowance will benefit by almost £600 per year.","504",NA
"We will also press for the introduction, in Scotland, of a pilot programme of carer’s leave.","504",NA
"We will not support attempts to restrict housing benefit for 18 to 21 year olds and believe exemptions to the Shared Accommodation Rate should be extended, for example, to cover all ages.","504",NA
"We believe that those who have been injured in the service of our country should get the full value of any war disablement pension and so will ensure that it is not treated as income in the assessment of entitlement to other benefits.","504",NA
"Ending fuel poverty has also been a key campaign for the SNP at Westminster for decades.","403",NA
"In this next Parliament, we will seek action to ensure that those using prepayment meters have access to the same lower energy prices available to those using other payment methods.","403",NA

"Evidence from the OECD shows that stronger trade unions tend to reduce inequality in labour income and ensure a more equal distribution of earnings.","405",NA

"We will urge the UK government to consult on how best to deliver such an increase.","405",NA

"Allocations from the next round of CFD should be made early and projects in Scotland should be prioritised and receive their fair share of funding.","501",NA
"We want to see a longterm commitment to the development of this industry.","501",NA
"We will continue to argue for changes to ensure that Scottish renewables, and Scotland’s islands, are not penalised because of their distance from markets in the south of England.","501",NA
"We believe that transmission arrangements should work to support, rather than undermine, production of renewable energy in the most favourable locations.","501",NA
"And we will press for onshore wind to continue to receive support through the lifetime of the next Parliament.","501",NA
"Our ambition is not limited to wind.","501",NA
"We want the UK government to remove barriers that are limiting growth in the hydro sector","501",NA

"The SDSR must also fully consider the advantages of a defence policy without weapons of mass destruction and wasting £100bn renewing Trident.","105",NA
"We will continue in our principled opposition to nuclear weapons and believe that the UK should abandon plans to renew the Trident nuclear missile system.","105",NA

"BBC Scotland should receive a fairer share of BBC income, reflecting more accurately the licence fee revenue raised here in Scotland.","301",NA

"DELIVERING HOME RULE FOR SCOTLAND",NA,NA
"The SNP believes that decisions about Scotland’s future – about our economy and society – are best taken by the people of Scotland:","301",NA
"the more powers we have in Scotland the more we can achieve for the people who live here.","301",NA
"That is why we campaigned for a Scottish Parliament and voted for the Scotland Act 1998.","301",NA
"It is why we supported the limited extension of devolution in the Scotland Act 2012, and called for a far more substantial package of powers at that point.","301",NA
"The same principle underpins our continued support for independence and was at the heart of our campaign for a Yes vote in September 2014.","301",NA
"During the referendum, the parties campaigning for a No vote promised the people of Scotland substantial new powers for our parliament,","301",NA
"amounting to real Home Rule, maximum devolution and as close to federalism as was possible.","301",NA
"It is our intention to hold them to that promise and the more SNP MPs elected in May, the greater our ability to deliver the strong package of effective devolution that people in Scotland want and need to build a fairer and more prosperous country.","301",NA
"We welcome the proposals set out in the Smith Commission, as far as they go.","301",NA
"The further watering down of the agreed proposals, by the UK government, is unacceptable.","301",NA
"There should be no effective veto for UK ministers on the exercise of the various new powers,","301",NA
"in particular over the welfare system.","504",NA
"We share the view of many organisations across Scotland that the package, as it stands, does not enable us to deliver fully either the greater social justice","503",NA
"or the powerhouse economy that our country demands.","410",NA
"As the STUC has said, “there is not enough” in the Smith Commission recommendations “to empower the Scottish Parliament to tackle inequality in Scotland"".","301",NA
"And, we agree with the Scottish Council of Voluntary Organisations (SCVO) “that anything less than wholesale devolution of welfare would be a real missed opportunity to meet the needs of the most vulnerable people in our communities”.","301",NA
"The Smith Commission proposals were, in many respects, a missed opportunity.","301",NA
"Decisions about more than 70 per cent of Scottish taxes and 85 per cent of current UK welfare spending in Scotland will stay at Westminster.","301",NA
"Instead of limited and unambitious proposals on tax powers, we should have a greater ability to generate economic growth,","410",NA
"deliver more employment opportunities","701",NA
"and support family incomes with the devolution of additional taxes.","503",NA
"Instead of leaving decisions on wages and employment with Westminster, devolving these key areas to Scotland means we could ensure that people in Scotland receive fair pay for a day’s work.","701",NA
"We could bring together, more effectively, skills development and employment support – enabling us to get more people into wellpaid and rewarding employment, closer to home.","701",NA
"And, instead of choices on most aspects of our welfare system remaining at Westminster, the full devolution of the welfare state would give us the ability to halt the cruelest and most damaging welfare changes and instead develop a system that supports people and families in their time of need.","504",NA
"It is only with the more extensive devolution of welfare, wages, taxation and the economy that we can deliver greater prosperity for more of our citizens and for Scotland as a whole.","301",NA
"Powers for a Purpose",NA,NA
"Our focus, therefore, will be securing specific new economic and social powers, over and above those set out in the Smith Commission proposals,","301",NA
"so we can tailor policy to make much more of the country’s strengths and finally address the challenges that we face as a society.","301",NA
"Scotland should have the opportunity to establish its own constitutional framework, including human rights, equalities and the place of local government.","204",NA
"The Scottish Parliament should also have the ability to directly represent its interests on devolved matters in the EU and internationally.","301",NA
"With more meaningful tax powers, we could provide more incentives and support for businesses to invest in Scotland","402",NA
"and enter new markets overseas,","402",NA
"encouraging inward investment and boosting our international exports.","402",NA
"We could also use targeted changes in business tax allowances to encourage higher levels of investment in capital or Research & Development, and encourage the growth of SMEs.","301",NA
"Proper economic powers would enable a fully cohesive industrial strategy focused on strengthening manufacturing and boosting innovation, allowing us to revitalise Scotland’s industries and rebalance our economy.","410",NA
"Full control over social protection would allow the Scottish Parliament to tailor a new and fairer welfare system for Scotland.","504",NA
"For example, no Scottish Government would have introduced the Bedroom Tax in Scotland and, looking forward, we would be able to protect people from any future ideological attacks from Westminster on the very essence of our social security system.","504",NA
"Devolving employment policy would allow us to take progressive action on low pay in order to tackle poverty and inequality,","503",NA
"with the power to raise the minimum wage, regardless of the political balance at Westminster","412",NA
"and we could more closely integrate skills and employment policy to support people in their search for rewarding work.","701",NA
"Securing Home Rule",NA,NA
"We will use the influence of SNP votes at Westminster to ensure that the promises made to Scotland during the referendum are delivered.","301",NA
"We will demand, firstly, that the proposals of the Smith Commission are delivered quickly and in full.","301",NA
"However, we believe that the proposals of the Smith Commission do not go far enough to honour the promises made during the referendum.","301",NA
"We will seek agreement that the Scottish Parliament should move to full financial responsibility.","301",NA
"As implementation of the Calman Commission proposals and the Scotland Act 2012 have demonstrated, the transition to full fiscal responsibility and agreement of the detailed fiscal framework that would require to underpin it would take a number of years to complete.","301",NA
"SNP MPs will work with the Scottish Government to secure the best deal for Scotland in these negotiations.","301",NA
"In the meantime, we will prioritise devolution of powers over employment policy, including the minimum wage,","301",NA
"welfare,","504",NA
"business taxes, national insurance","402",NA
"and equality policy","503",NA
"the powers we need to create jobs,","701",NA
"grow revenues","410",NA
"and lift people out of poverty.","503",NA
"As we set out in our submission to the Smith Commission, the Barnett Formula should continue to be used to determine Scotland's resources during the transition to full fiscal responsibility and for as long as the Scottish Parliament's financial powers fall short of full responsibility.","301",NA
"SCOTLAND’S OPPORTUNITY",NA,NA
"This General Election is an exciting opportunity for Scotland to have real power at Westminster.","301",NA
"The SNP goes into this election with a clear message none of us can afford more austerity//.","409",NA
"Our NHS, our economy and our children can't afford the billions of pounds of additional cuts that the Tories, Labour and Liberals have signed up to.","409",NA
"And none of us can afford the £100 billion they plan to spend on new nuclear weapons.","105",NA
"The Westminster parties have the wrong priorities.","301",NA
"And it will be ordinary people across the UK who will pay the price.","503",NA
"Unless you choose differently.","301",NA
"Labour alone won't be bold enough to deliver the change ordinary people need.","305",NA
"A big team of SNP MPs can force the pace of progressive change.","301",NA
"We offer an alternative.","301",NA
"A responsible plan for modest spending increases","409",NA
"and real investment in the NHS, housing, childcare","504",NA
"and jobs.","701",NA
"An SNP vote on May 7th will be a vote to make Scotland's voice heard loudly and clearly.","301",NA
"But ours will also be a voice for a new, better and more progressive politics at Westminster for everyone.","202",NA
