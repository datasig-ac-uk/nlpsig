"Setting rates of income tax is now the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament.","301",NA
"In the current financial year, we have frozen the basic rate of income tax to help low and middle earners","701",NA
"- and we have opted not to cut tax for higher rate taxpayers through an increase in the higher rate threshold.","704",NA
"Until such time as the Scottish Parliament controls the rules on income tax avoidance, there is a risk that an increase in the Additional Rate of income tax in Scotland alone would lead to a loss of revenue.","605.1",NA

"According to the Resolution Foundation, the UK is on course for the biggest increase in inequality since the days of Margaret Thatcher.","503",NA
"SNP MPs will vote against further cuts to social security.","504",NA
"We will also press for the abolition of the two child cap on tax credits","504",NA
"and the associated Rape Clause.","503",NA
"And we will vote to ensure that benefits increase at least in line with CPI inflation.","504",NA

"To boost productivity, we will also support extension of the Annual Investment Allowance, which encourages firms to invest in plant and machinery.","402",NA

"and an industrial strategy that works for Scotland.","301",NA
"More powers for the Scottish Parliament","H",NA
"We will seek additional powers for the Scottish Parliament to boost our economy,","410",NA
"mitigate the damage of Brexit,","108",NA
"and protect the most vulnerable in our society from damaging Tory cuts.","504",NA

"SNP MPs will support repeal of the Trade Union Act 2016","701",NA

"Low pay and falling real wages is a driver of increasing inequality and therefore one of the biggest challenges of the next Parliament.","503",NA
"We will support moves over the next Parliament to increase the Minimum Wage to the level of the real Living Wage.","412",NA
"The Scottish Government has supported public sector workers through a difficult time of pay restraint with additional measures to tackle low pay.","701",NA

"A majority of people in Scotland voted to remain in the EU - but even many of those who voted to leave have real concerns about the extreme Brexit being pursued by the Prime Minister.","108",NA
"Leaving the Single Market could cost 80,000 jobs in Scotland.","701",NA
"That is why the Scottish Government published proposals that would keep Scotland in the Single Market, even as we left the EU.","407",NA
"These proposals were rejected by the UK government.","301",NA
"However, if the SNP wins this election, we will demand a place for Scotland at the Brexit negotiating table and the inclusion of the case for our place in the Single Market in the UK’s negotiating remit.","301",NA
"Scotland’s choice","H",NA
"At the end of the Brexit process, when the final terms of the deal are known, it is right that Scotland should have a choice about our future.","301",NA
"Brexit must not simply be imposed on Scotland no matter how damaging it turns out to be.","301",NA
"Last year’s Holyrood election delivered the democratic mandate for an independence referendum.","202.4",NA
"The recent vote of Scotland’s national Parliament has underlined that mandate.","301",NA
"If the SNP wins a majority of Scottish seats in this election, that would complete a triple lock, further reinforcing the democratic mandate which already exists.","301",NA
"And, in such circumstances, any continued Tory attempts to block the people of Scotland having a choice on their future - when the time is right and the options are clear - would be democratically unsustainable.","301",NA

"STANDING UP FOR SCOTLAND",NA,NA
"BY ANGUS ROBERTSON",NA,NA
"In the last two years your SNP team at Westminster has worked tirelessly to stand up for Scotland.",NA,NA
"We’ve ensured that, at every opportunity, Scotland’s interests have been represented.",NA,NA
"We will not allow the Tory government to go unopposed. We will work to protect our schools, hospitals and pensions from more Tory cuts. And we will never allow the Tories to trade away our jobs and industries in Brexit negotiations.",NA,NA
"We’ve fought unnecessary Tory cuts to public services and immoral policies like the Rape Clause, the Bedroom Tax, and welfare cuts pushing children into poverty.",NA,NA
"Only a vote for the SNP on 8 June will ensure Scotland has a strong voice at Westminster, standing against Tory cuts.",NA,NA
"And we’ve shown Westminster what hard¬working MPs should look like – doing more and costing less than our predecessors.",NA,NA
"I’m immensely proud of what we’ve achieved over these two years. But there’s much more to do.",NA,NA
"Now, more than ever, it’s vital that Scotland continues to have strong voices at Westminster.",NA,NA
"Angus Robertson",NA,NA
"ENDING THE CALLOUS TORY BENEFIT SANCTIONS REGIME",NA,NA
"BY MHAIRI BLACK",NA,NA
"The Tory obsession with austerity is a political choice, not a necessity. The punitive benefit sanctions regime is one of the worst policies to ever come out of Westminster.",NA,NA
"As a new MP I vowed to make some commonsense changes to benefit sanctions. Last year I secured a Private Member’s Bill to ensure that a person’s mental health, caring responsibilities and risk of homelessness were accounted for before a sanction could be applied",NA,NA
"Disgracefully the Bill was shot down. Very few Labour MPs even showed up and the Tory Minister used Parliamentary tactics to dismiss it.",NA,NA
"If I had the power to do so, I’d scrap this cruel and callous regime immediately. That’s why I am proud that the SNP government in Scotland has chosen to take a different approach. The SNP puts people first. We’re committed to placing dignity and respect at the heart of the new social security system in Scotland. No government should be making its own citizens destitute and that is exactly what the Tory government is doing.",NA,NA
"Disadvantaged and low income individuals in Scotland must be protected not punished.",NA,NA
"Only a strong team of SNP MPs can take the fight to Theresa May and halt the unfair benefit sanctions regime.",NA,NA
"CAMPAIGNING AGAINST THE ABHORRENT RAPE CLAUSE",NA,NA
"BY ALISON THEWLISS",NA,NA
"At the first Budget after the 2015 General Election, the Tories announced they would restrict eligibility for Child Tax Credits to the first two children in a family.",NA,NA
"For larger families, the impact of this cut is huge. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimated that nearly one million three and four-child families will be worse off by thousands of pounds a year because of this cut.",NA,NA
"Poring over the Budget document, I noticed that the Tories two-child policy also contained sinister small print – an exemption if it could be proven that the third or subsequent child being claimed for was conceived as a result of rape.",NA,NA
"Putting victims through the trauma of having to prove they were raped to the Department for Work and Pensions, just to receive support for their children, is abhorrent and appalling. This is a new low for the Tories.",NA,NA
"Working with women’s organisations, the SNP continues to campaign to scrap the regressive two-child policy and the repugnant Rape Clause. We haven’t and we won’t shy away from taking the Tories to task on their ideological, punitive cuts.",NA,NA
"The SNP stands up for all children in Scotland.",NA,NA
"STANDING UP FOR OUR OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY",NA,NA
"BY CALLUM MCCAIG",NA,NA
"Scotland’s oil and gas industry is vital to our economy and jobs. Yet there has been a lack of action from the Tory government at Westminster since the downturn in the sector.",NA,NA
"At Westminster, we’ve consistently stood up for the sector.",NA,NA
"Only after pressure from SNP MPs did the Tory Chancellor abolish the petroleum revenue tax and halve the supplementary charge to 10 per cent. That’s just a start.",NA,NA
"Further measures to support the industry are urgent and cannot continue to be ignored. Time and time again, the Tories have turned down our proposals on further support through late life transfers, decommissioning and exploration incentives. We will not let a Tory government at Westminster get away with destroying another vital Scottish industry. Our oil and gas industry can have a bright future, but it needs a UK government that is willing to act. Only strong SNP voices can ensure this happens.",NA,NA
"COMBATTING DOMESTIC AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE",NA,NA
"BY DR EILIDH WHITEFORD",NA,NA
"The reality is that one in four women, and some men and boys, will experience these types of violence over the course of their lives. It impacts us all, not just those directly affected.",NA,NA
"Most of us will have a relative, friend or colleague with first-hand experience, and know the toll it takes on families and relationships.",NA,NA
"The Istanbul Convention is a comprehensive international treaty aimed at securing minimum standards to prevent and combat domestic and sexual violence. It’s recognised as the best framework in the world to tackle gender-based violence.",NA,NA
"My new Bill will ensure that the Istanbul Convention is incorporated into UK law. It will make it much more difficult to cut services offering refuge for survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault or rape, and will help improve the experiences of victims within the judicial system.",NA,NA
"I’m proud that it was the SNP that led the campaign to get the Istanbul Convention on the UK statute book. SNP MPs will now ensure there is a clear timetable for the work towards finally eradicating domestic violence.",NA,NA
"Earlier this year my Bill to ensure new action on domestic violence was passed at Westminster with cross-party support.",NA,NA
"FIGHTING THE TORIES’ GREAT RURAL ROBBERY",NA,NA
"BY CALUM KERR",NA,NA
"It’s never been more important for our rural communities to have a strong voice at Westminster. With more SNP MPs since 2015 that’s what we’ve been delivering.",NA,NA
"As SNP rural affairs spokesperson I’ve challenged the Tory decision to rob Scottish farmers of £190 million of EU money, which only came to the UK because of Scotland’s historically low average farm payments. I will continue to fight for this funding to be passed on to Scotland’s farmers.",NA,NA
"As the UK leaves the EU, there is still no firm guarantee that EU powers and funding over farming will return to Scotland.",NA,NA
"At Westminster, I’ll continue to fight any Tory power grab.",NA,NA
"Our fishing communities know the consequences of leaving the Tories in charge. They need an unequivocal commitment that their livelihoods will not be bargaining chips in Brexit negotiations or treated, again, as ‘expendable’. SNP MPs will continue to put the concerns of our fishing sector front and centre. At this election we face an unfettered Tory government ready to grab farming powers for themselves and sell-out our fishing industry. Only the SNP will put Scotland’s rural communities first and put more power in Scotland’s hands.",NA,NA
"WORKING HARDER, COSTING LESS","H",NA
"SNP MPs spoke in an average 61 debates in 2015-16, compared to 27 for their predecessors in 2014-15.","305.1",NA
"Since 2015, SNP MPs tabled 4,000 written questions to the UK government.","202.1",NA
"SNP MPs cost £1 million less in 2015-16 than their predecessors did in 2014-15.","303",NA
"FIGHTING FOR OUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBOURS FROM OTHER EU COUNTRIES",NA,NA
"BY STEPHEN GETINS",NA,NA
"Theresa May has, time and time again, refused to provide any firm answers for our EU neighbours, colleagues and friends. Instead she has made a series of vague commitments to seeking an early resolution to the issue. It’s just not good enough.",NA,NA
"The Prime Minister cannot speak on one hand of building a fairer and global UK whilst also jeopardising the status and rights of EU citizens who have made the UK their home.",NA,NA
"EU nationals contribute immeasurably to our economy, our public services and our culture. By giving straightforward access to permanent residence, we can end the uncertainty about their future.",NA,NA
"The SNP will continue to stand up for the rights of EU citizens at Westminster. And if the UK government chooses not to give EU nationals the certainty they deserve, then immigration powers should be devolved so that Scotland can do so.",NA,NA
"Leaving the EU will have an impact on every one of us. For EU nationals in particular, Brexit will bring uncertainty about their right to continue living and working in Scotland.",NA,NA
"DEMANDING ACTION ON TAX EVASI0N",NA,NA
"BY ROGER MULLIN",NA,NA
"When it was revealed that SLPs were being used for criminal activity, fraud and tax avoid-ance, we knew we had to act fast to protect Scotland’s reputation as a world class place to do business.",NA,NA
"While the Tories at Westminster were happy to do nothing, we pressed them for action. We repeatedly submitted amendments to Bills. We raised the issue in debates and at Prime Min-ister’s Questions. We wrote letters to the UK government, calling for a robust strategy.",NA,NA
"Scottish Limited Partnerships (SLPs) are a way of registering businesses that has existed for over a century.",NA,NA
"After repeatedly disregarding their duty to act, the Tories were eventually forced to do a u-turn and instigate a review into limited partnerships and criminality - in the face of mounting evidence, inter-national scandals, and, of course, the unrelenting efforts of SNP MPs.",NA,NA
"It’s a step closer to a robust solution to this serious issue, but only the SNP will ensure the Tories aren’t let off the hook.",NA,NA
"PROTECTING OUR PUBLIC SERVICES","H",NA
"Tackling austerity and securing investment in our public services will be the priority for SNP MPs.","504",NA
"We have a plan to repair the public finances by the end of this Parliament,","414",NA
"while freeing up additional resources to end austerity and support investment in our public services.","504",NA
"Ending austerity and investing in public services","H",NA
"SNP MPs will demand an end to austerity.","504",NA
"We will demand a new, credible fiscal plan for the UK.","408",NA
"The UK government’s current fiscal plans are driven more by ideology and their own political interests than the interests of the country.","305.1",NA
"They intend to build up a financial war-chest ahead of the next election – and they will do it on the back of the poorest in society by slashing welfare.","504",NA
"This is neither morally acceptable nor economically necessary.","504",NA
"Our alternative fiscal plan has three key aims: Balance the budget by the end of the Parliament","414",NA
"We will propose to achieve a current budget balance by the end of the next Parliament in 2021/22","414",NA
"with net borrowing being used only for investment from that year onwards.","414",NA
"Return the deficit to its pre-crash long-term average","414",NA
"Under our plans, the UK’s net borrowing requirement will fall to 2.3 per cent of GDP – the thirty-year, long-term average for net borrowing prior to the financial crisis.","414",NA
"It will reach this level in 2020/21 and remain there in 2021/22.","414",NA
"Set debt on a downward path from 2019/20","414",NA
"These steps will see debt falling as a percentage of GDP from 2019/20, meeting the current target on public sector net debt.","414",NA
"This plan will release almost £120 billion for public spending over the next Parliament,","504",NA
"while returning the UK’s finances to a stable, sustainable path.","414",NA
"The cost of Tory cuts",NA,NA
"Over the 10-year period from 2010-11 and 2019-20,",NA,NA
"the Tories will have cut Scottish Government day-to-day spending by £2.9 billion in real terms.",NA,NA
"That is enough to:",NA,NA
"•build the new Queensferry Crossing twice, or",NA,NA
"•build the new Queen Elizabeth Hospital – Europe’s largest – three times, or",NA,NA
"•train more than 3,800 consultant doctors",NA,NA
"Fair and balanced personal taxation","H",NA
"We will back tax proposals that promote fairness,","503",NA
"while raising the revenues required to protect the public services we all rely on.","504",NA
"Setting rates of Income Tax is now the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament.","301",NA
"In the current financial year, we have frozen the basic rate of Income Tax to help low and middle earners","701",NA
"- and we have opted not to cut tax for higher rate taxpayers through an increase in the higher rate threshold.","408",NA
"Until such time as the Scottish Parliament controls the rules on income tax avoidance, there is a risk that an increase in the additional rate of Income Tax in Scotland alone would lead to a loss of revenue.","408",NA
"However, we support an increase in the Additional Rate from 45p to 50p across the UK as a whole from 2018/19.","503",NA
"We will support the reversal of the married couple’s allowance,","604",NA
"the reversal of the reductions to the bank levy","403",NA
"and introduction of a tax on bankers’ bonuses.","503",NA
"We will not support further reductions to Corporation Tax.","403",NA
"At a time when household budgets are under pressure and consumer confidence in Scotland is low, SNP MPs will back a freeze on National Insurance contributions and Value Added Tax.","403",NA
"We will back the continuation of VAT-exemption on essential items like children’s clothes,","403",NA
"and will hold the UK government to a commitment to remove VAT from sanitary products.","403",NA
"Until VAT is removed from sanitary products, SNP MPs will call for Scotland’s population share of the Tampon Tax Fund to be transferred to the Scottish Government so that a fair and proportionate amount can be distributed to organisations working with and for women across Scotland.","503",NA
"Improving tax collection","H",NA
"SNP MPs will back improvements to tax collection","303",NA

"•measures to improve the transparency of tax paid by major international companies;","403",NA
"•and further action by the UK government to tackle international tax avoidance.","605.1",NA
"Protecting our health service","H",NA
"We all rely on our NHS – that is why we are committed to making sure it is fit for the future.","504",NA
"The SNP Scottish Government is already committed to an increase in the NHS revenue budget of £500 million more than inflation by the end of the current term of the Scottish Parliament.","504",NA
"That means the budget will increase by £2 billion in total.","504",NA
"Latest statistics show that overall health spending in Scotland is around 7 per cent per head higher than in England.","504",NA
"If the UK government were to match Scotland, England’s Health investment would increase by over £11 billion above inflation by the end of this Parliament.","504",NA
"At Westminster, SNP MPs will argue for an increase in frontline health spending – and the Scottish Government will ensure that any consequential funding from this goes to Scotland’s health service.","504",NA
"We will always vote to protect the health service in all parts of the UK from privatisation – as any moves to privatise the NHS in England could lead to the erosion of the budget that is available to Scotland.","504",NA
