"Since devolution was restored to Northern Ireland in 2007 real progress has been made across a range of areas.","301",NA
"Despite all of the political ups and downs, Northern Ireland is slowly but surely moving in the right direction again.","601",NA
"Over these last eight years we have been working to secure Northern Ireland’s position within the UK,","601",NA
"to help grow our economy,","410",NA
"to offer opportunity to all","503",NA
"and to build reconciliation and address the legacy of the past.","106",NA
"This challenge has been made all the more difficult by virtue of the global economic downturn,","410",NA
"the reduction in public expenditure available to the Northern Ireland Executive","602",NA
"and the system of government we operate.","602",NA
"In spite of this, things are changing for the better.","601",NA
"The transformation is visible wherever you look.","601",NA
"Northern Ireland is now a venue not just for international investment, but for events that would not have considered coming here just a few years ago.","601",NA
"We have a plan for where we want Northern Ireland to be in 2021, the hundredth anniversary of Northern Ireland’s creation.","601",NA
"We have been working to deliver it.","601",NA
"However, the election on 7 May will give Northern Ireland the opportunity of a lifetime to transform our Province for generations.","601",NA
"It is highly likely that after that election no single party will have enough seats to command a majority in the House of Commons.","305",NA
"That means that the votes of our MPs could be crucial.","305",NA
"Political commentators have consistently stated that the DUP could be crucial in what looks likely to be a hung Parliament.","305",NA

"To do so we need help from Westminster and we need to take bold steps at home as well.","410",NA
"The influence that we may have after this election gives us the once in a lifetime opportunity to transform our economic fortunes for generations to come.","410",NA
"In doing so we are building on firm foundations that have been laid over the last few years.","410",NA
"In 2007 we made growing our economy the Executive’s number one priority.","410",NA
"The restoration of devolution to Northern Ireland has created the peace and political stability to encourage foreign direct investment at record levels.","410",NA
"In fact despite the worldwide economic downturn more jobs have been created in Northern Ireland over the last four years than at any time in recorded history.","410",NA
"Global businesses establishing in Northern Ireland are now the norm rather than the exception.","410",NA
"Our claimant count has been falling for over 25 months and our headline rate of unemployment is broadly in line with the UK average.","410",NA
"For the first time in many years Northern Ireland is emerging from an economic downturn alongside, rather than after the rest of the UK.","410",NA
"After years of campaigning we managed to persuade the UK Government to allow the Assembly to set a Northern Ireland Corporation Tax Rate","402",NA

"We have invested in our tourism infrastructure with signature projects such as Titanic Belfast","410",NA

"One of the most important duties of any government is to deliver high quality public services.","504",NA
"This task is challenging given the increasing expectations and increased demand and the reduction in public expenditure available to Northern Ireland.","504",NA
"However, despite the difficulties we have sought to meet the needs of our people by prioritising our key public services,","504",NA
"saving money by cutting waste","303",NA
"and by reforming the services that we deliver.","303",NA
"With the reduction in public expenditure over recent years we have had to prioritise what we need most and focus on what matters most to our people.","303",NA
"In spite of the £1.5 billion reduction, in real terms, in the funding we receive in Northern Ireland, over the last eight years we have made health","504",NA
"and education our top two priorities in terms of public expenditure.","506",NA
"As a result we have increases in spending on health by 33%","504",NA
"and education by 23% since 2007.","506",NA
"That has allowed us to make sure we spend the money available to us on the areas that matter most to the general public.","303",NA
"As part of this process we have set ambitious targets in terms of achieving savings across government departments.","303",NA
"As a result in the last two Assembly terms savings of over £4 billion have been achieved to free up money from important frontline services.","303",NA
"Those savings have been critical to ensuring we continue to deliver the best quality public services.","503",NA
"Since the restoration of devolution we have also invested more in capital spending in areas such as schools, hospitals and roads than at any point in our history.","503",NA
"That has meant more new schools, hospitals and roads and other key capital infrastructure.","503",NA
"The Northern Ireland Executive has also undertaken a significant programme of public sector reform with major changes in education administration, the health service and in local government.","303",NA
"These decisions will allow more resources to be targeted on front line services and less on administration in future years.","303",NA
"We have played our part in making the best use of the resources that are available to us","303",NA
"but it is always the dedication and commitment of those who work in the public sector that ensures world class public services can be delivered.","701",NA
"The challenges of delivering world class public services will only increase in the years to come but with support from Westminster and the right decisions taken at home we can not only meet but exceed expectations of our people.","601",NA
"Deliver world class public services for our people",NA,NA

"One of our key goals has been to ensure that everyone can benefit from the new era that Northern Ireland has now entered and no one is left behind.","503",NA
"That means there must be the opportunity for everyone to succeed and a fair and level playing field for all.","503",NA
"This approach will not only create a society based on fairness but it will maximise the interests of Northern Ireland as a whole.","503",NA
"We have been working to achieve the twin goals of fairness and opportunity for all in recent years through a range of measures.","503",NA
"Through the Stormont House Agreement we sought to deliver affordable changes to the welfare system that would protect the most vulnerable","503",NA
"but would also encourage people back to work.","505",NA
"That includes ensuring that the bedroom tax is not in operation in Northern Ireland.","503",NA
"In dealing with the issue of welfare reform it is vital that we keep the proper balance between enhancing the GB welfare system and the protection of frontline public services.","414",NA
"We have sought to keep higher education open to all by keeping student fees much lower than in England.","506",NA
"Through the Social Investment Fund we have worked with communities to deliver programmes tailored to meet their specific needs.","503",NA

"We have also ensured that local household taxes in Northern Ireland are significantly lower than anywhere else in the UK","403",NA
"and have resisted the introduction of Water Charges.","503",NA

"For the first time in generations, despite all of the challenges and difficulties, Northern Ireland has had almost eight years of uninterrupted devolution.","301",NA
"Given the history of the last fifty years this is in itself a remarkable achievement.","301",NA
"During this time we have overcome many problems and have put in place arrangements that have been robust and stable.","301",NA
"We do not seek to do anything which will threaten the long term stability of the political institutions however, we must now make sure that it works better in delivering for the people we represent.","202",NA
"In seeking to create a better system of government we should remember the progress that we have made.","202",NA
"The St Andrews Agreement corrected some of the key flaws of the Belfast Agreement but we continue to work towards more normal politics in Northern Ireland.","202",NA
"As a result of these changes important decisions require Executive approval and we have a veto over all big issues.","301",NA
"After years of debate and dispute we negotiated appropriate arrangements which allowed Policing and Justice powers to be passed to the Assembly in 2010 on a basis which requires the Justice Minister to be able to command a cross community majority and have operated well since","301",NA
".",NA,NA
"For many years we have campaigned for changes to how devolution operates.","204",NA
