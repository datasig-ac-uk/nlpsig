"Prior to the agreement, no Council in Northern Ireland had ever had such a deal.","301",NA
"No Northern Ireland Council had ever been proposed for one by the national government.","301",NA
"The DUP made such growth deals a priority for Councils in Northern Ireland.","305.1",NA
"This will be the long-lasting legacy of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.","305.1",NA
"Helping Family Incomes Grow","H",NA
"The era of austerity is over.","402",NA
"Public spending and tax policy should reflect that.","402",NA
"The DUP believes money is better in your pocket than the government’s.","401",NA
"A successful economy is built upon a strong working population,","701",NA
"an entrepreneurial spirit","402",NA
"and a welcoming financial environment.","402",NA
"People should be as free as possible to enjoy the fruits of their labour","701",NA
"while ensuring the necessary level of public services.","504",NA
"Those that have worked hard all their lives should not be penalised in retirement.","504",NA
"Personal Taxes and Incomes","H",NA
"The gradual increase in the personal tax allowance has been positive for all taxpayers,","401",NA
"but especially for the lowest paid, taking them out of the tax system entirely.","503",NA
"The DUP were to the fore in calling for increases in the personal tax allowance, which has subsequently benefited many people in Northern Ireland.","401",NA
"We want to see new reforms progressed that will benefit the lowest paid the most.","503",NA
"In this Parliament the DUP will support: The Personal Tax allowance should rise in line with inflation each year.","401",NA
"Over the Parliamentary term, National Insurance allowances should be raised until they match personal tax allowances.","401",NA
"The DUP will support a rise in the National Living Wage (NLW) to £10.50 by the end of the Parliamentary term","412",NA
"and reducing the NLW starting age to 21.","412",NA
"Robust action against companies who fail to comply with the National Living Wage.","412",NA
"The freeze on benefits should end, with rises in line with inflation.","504",NA
"The Working Tax Credit should increase by the rate of inflation plus 0.5%.","504",NA
"The two-child limit on Universal credit should be raised to 3 and then 4 in this Parliamentary term.","504",NA
"The People’s Choice","H",NA
"The new and older generations have seen a transformation in how they access and watch their film, television and music entertainment including Netflix, Amazon, Now TV, Spotify, AppleTV etc.","401",NA
"Each person gets to decide which services they want and what they are willing to pay - free to choose what they spend their money on.","401",NA
"This transformation has made the BBC licence fee, a regressive tax on the poorest, an anachronism.","503",NA
"The licence fee should be abolished.","401",NA
"People should be free to choose how they spend this extra £154.50 a year on whatever they want.","401",NA
"The BBC boasts of the quality of what it produces.","401",NA
"However, this is not an argument against change, but for it.","401",NA
"This confidence in its product is surely what can make it flourish as a successful subscription-based service and grow beyond the UK as a high-quality global brand.","401",NA
"Freedom for licence fee payers will also mean freedom for the BBC to grow to something even bigger and better, and create fairer competition for media outlets nationally and locally.","401",NA
"Supporting Older People","H",NA
"The DUP has a strong record as a champion of older people.","504",NA
"We will continue to do so in Parliament by supporting: The restoration of the free BBC licence to all those aged over 75, for as long as it continues to exist.","504",NA
"The pensions ‘triple lock’ protection and retaining winter fuel payments as a universal benefit.","504",NA
"Action on the unfair treatment of women pensioners with a suitable compensatory scheme established.","504",NA
"Family Budgets and Taxes","H",NA
"VAT and other indirect taxes are a key strain on family budgets","503",NA
"and leaving the European Union effectively will give the UK the flexibility it needs to act.","110",NA
"The DUP will support: Zero rating of domestic electricity and gas to reduce bills","503",NA
"and encourage take up of more environmentally friendly heating technologies.","416.2",NA
"This needs to be complemented by energy efficiency programmes that make these viable alternatives to oil for off gas grid and rural homes.","416.2",NA
"Zero rating on sanitary products.","503",NA
"Reduce the Insurance Premium Tax by 1% every year of the Parliamentary term.","503",NA
"Zero rating for new Electric Vehicles for domestic use,","416.2",NA
"reducing VAT rating for new Hybrid cars in addition to existing government support","416.2",NA
"and increasing the charge point grant up to £750.","416.2",NA
"Abolish Domestic Air Passenger Duty - it is a faux environmental tax that has a disproportionately negative impact on the peripheral parts of the UK.","503",NA
"Maintaining the freeze in fuel duty.","503",NA
"Pension Changes","H",NA
"The Government was right to ensure people make greater pension provision.","504",NA
"People should have the resources to enjoy a comfortable retirement.","504",NA
"However, there have been a series of changes to the pension system combined with changes to defined benefits schemes which are creating significant disincentives for people to progress in key organisations and operate optimally in the NHS without punitive tax bills.","504",NA
"These often function as stealth taxation.","504",NA
"The pension system must: Scrap the tapered annual allowance","504",NA
"and review the annual allowance for defined benefit schemes.","504",NA
"Within two years establish comprehensive, user-friendly pensions dashboards for self-employed people","504",NA
"with the necessary legislation to compel pension schemes to share data.","504",NA
"Fairness in Public Sector Pay","H",NA
"With the end of austerity, there needs to be a prioritisation of the public sector pay rises","701",NA
"especially in our NHS,","504",NA
"police","605.1",NA
"and armed forces.","104",NA
"This means pay rises should not only take account of inflation but of the need to uplift rates to restore the full value of public sector pay.","701",NA
"Social Care & the Blood Scandal","H",NA
"The United Kingdom faces a growing ageing population with higher and more complex health needs.","504",NA
"The decline of family and community networks increases the demands on public services.","504",NA
"The costs of social care are a significant burden and fear for older people and their families.","504",NA
"This needs a national solution.","504",NA
"The DUP calls for: A Royal Commission, drawn across parties and constituent parts of the UK, to be appointed to produce proposals for supporting and sustaining a modern Social Care system.","504",NA
"It would report within 18 months of the new Parliament meeting.","504",NA
"Another national health issue needing resolution is those affected by the contaminated blood scandal.","504",NA
"The DUP supports: Establishing a compensation panel for the victims and families of those who suffered from receiving contaminated blood products.","503",NA
"National Infrastructure Investment that delivers for the United Kingdom","H",NA
"Northern Ireland is on the geographic periphery of the Atlantic Ocean, British Isles and Europe.","601.1",NA
"Even if within Northern Ireland we had a fully upgraded road network, expanding public transport, up to date airports, modern shipping ports and the latest digital infrastructure the networks and connectivity beyond our shores are crucial to us.","411",NA
"What is built or not built in Great Britain matters to Northern Ireland.","601.1",NA
"Spend Better – Cancel HS2","H",NA
"The economic case for HS2 simply does not stand up.","411",NA
"The scale of investment in one route cannot be justified.","411",NA
"It is about making more of England a suburb of London than rebalancing and expanding the economy of the United Kingdom,","411",NA
"and an unwillingness to stop a poor project simply because money has already been spent.","411",NA
"The money should still be invested and spent better on: Expansion of the public transport bus fleet","411",NA
"and shifting it to alternative energies and away from diesel.","416.2",NA
"Buses, often overlooked, are the main form of public transport.","411",NA
"For the rail network the priorities should be the Northern Powerhouse Rail (HS3),","411",NA
"overhaul of bottlenecks in the UK rail system","411",NA
"and upgrading of rolling stock.","411",NA
"Investment in the strategic road network","411",NA
"including in more and better lorry park facilities.","411",NA
"If the feasibility study on a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland concludes positively, this should also be pursued with the national government and devolved institutions working together to take it forward.","411",NA
"In the midst of the fevered debate about the likelihood or viability of this connection too many have chosen to ignore the importance of that route for business and people","411",NA
"and the expensiveness of the NI-Scotland crossing currently, costs which are about to increase even more with the Shipping Low Sulphur Surcharge.","411",NA
"The route’s inclusion as a European super-highway is a testament to its importance but also deeply ironic since it is anything but super.","411",NA
"In particular, the A77 to the Central belt of Scotland and the A75 to the North of England are badly maintained, under-invested and not fit for Northern Ireland’s purposes.","411",NA
"With alternative routes for Scottish businesses, the areas being lesser populated and not an SNP stronghold, the likelihood of them being made a priority by the Scottish government is low.","411",NA
"Therefore, the DUP proposes: The national government should make investment in these roads a national infrastructure priority,","411",NA
"especially the A75 as Northern Ireland’s main connection to the Northern Powerhouse.","411",NA
"Build Heathrow’s Third Runway","H",NA
"The UK needs more international air linkages and following extensive research the conclusion is that the third runway at Heathrow represents the best solution for the UK.","411",NA
"Such a positive and strategic intervention must also deliver for the regions of the UK.","411",NA
"The expansion of Heathrow must be on the condition of designated slots for regional interconnection and that this investment has an impact across the UK.","411",NA
"Northern Ireland is well placed to host one of the Heathrow construction hubs due to be set up as part of its airport expansion programme.","411",NA
"If chosen, this project will act as a catalyst for long term economic growth across the Province and further underpin the local reputation for excellence in the construction and manufacturing sectors.","411",NA
"This extra national capacity needs to be complemented by establishing a new Air Routes Task Force.","411",NA
"Digital Infrastructure","H",NA
"Digital network infrastructure, which connects us to the Internet, and to each other, is increasingly recognised as core economic infrastructure, like electricity, gas and water.","411",NA
"They are central to tackling the UK’s productivity problem.","411",NA
"The DUP will support: Full fibre networks for the UK.","411",NA
"5G network rollout.","411",NA
"Energy","H",NA
"Interconnection is central to a future energy strategy especially to those countries with stronger access to renewables.","411",NA
"The DUP supports: The pursuit of a strong interconnection strategy including with Iceland (and examination of Icelandic interconnection making landfall in Northern Ireland).","411",NA
"Representation","H",NA
"The National Infrastructure Commission should aspire to be just that, truly national.","301",NA
"Therefore, in addition to the members appointed by the national government, the devolved institutions should be able to nominate a suitably experienced appointee.","301",NA
"Truly Internationally Competitive","H",NA
"Our economy will be driven forward by investment in strategic infrastructure","411",NA
"in a business-friendly environment,","402",NA
"but equally if not more important will be our people and their skills.","701",NA
"To achieve these goals the DUP will support: A ‘UK’ Growth vision – The central tenet of economic growth should not simply be strong growth in the national GDP","410",NA
"but that growth is spread throughout.","301",NA
"The development of Industrial Strategies across the UK needs to be complementary and co-ordinated.","410",NA
"This should ensure regional specialisations and maximise the opportunities for UK supply chains.","410",NA
"Corporation Tax rates kept under review to ensure they remain competitive against our main economic arrivals.","402",NA
"Increase the Employment Allowance for National Insurance payments to £4,000.","504",NA
"Introduction of time-limited capital allowances for businesses to support capital investment.","402",NA
"Abolish and replace the Apprenticeship Levy – This levy is a stealth tax that is not contributing to our local and national skills shortage and our productivity problem.","402",NA
"It should be replaced by a private sector focused levy co-designed between employers and government with any resources it raises ringfenced for skills.","402",NA
"This will show a clear pathway between their contributions and the provision of apprenticeship services.","402",NA
"Develop a long-term plan between government, industry and universities to increase Research and Development in the UK to 3% of GDP.","402",NA
"Make the UK a partner of choice for international research collaborations both with EU programmes and global opportunities.","402",NA
"Significantly increased funding for the Small Business Research Initiative (SBRI)","402",NA
"This has proved a considerable success, both in terms of supporting small business growth and the development of innovative products across a whole range of sectors.","402",NA
"Strengthening the regional identifiers e.g. ‘Made in Northern Ireland’ across the United Kingdom, as a key element of growing global exports promotion and linked to the new Industrial strategies.","601.1",NA
"No diminution of workers’ rights","701",NA
"The development of a successful and productive workforce is built on a clear framework of respect between employers and employees and maximising certainty for both.","701",NA
"The UK’s workers’ rights are substantially better than most","701",NA
"Boosting productivity by overhauling and expanding post start-up business support, to aid those businesses wanting to scale up in size and expand.","402",NA
"There has long been a gap between start-up and mature business support and this should be urgently addressed across the UK.","402",NA
"A UK wide programme to identify and develop a new generation of entrepreneurial business leaders, those with the ambition to think globally and with the drive to create and lead businesses of the future.","402",NA
"Fair Banking for Small Businesses by taking forward the proposed banking reforms of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking.","402",NA
"Overhaul of corporate governance and audit to restore trust in business and reduce the likelihood of corporate collapses such as Carillion and Thomas Cook","403",NA
"as well as systematic abuses of small businesses by the likes of Lloyds and HBoS.","403",NA
"A UK wide enterprise strategy which harnesses the skills and experience of those in sectors such as advanced manufacturing, engineering and technology to create and lead in the sectors of the future.","411",NA
"These will be the businesses which create future jobs","701",NA
"and the UK has a history of leading in new industries.","601.1",NA
"That time has come again – to lead, into the future.","601.1",NA
"Delivery of the Northern Ireland International Trade plan including: a new Trade Advisory Board","601.1",NA
"the appointment of Northern Ireland Trade Ambassadors","601.1",NA
"the creation of new trade, investment and innovation hubs in key global markets","402",NA
"a Trade Accelerator Plan including an enhanced range of initiatives to help support both new and existing exporters to explore new markets","402",NA
"Leaving the European Union as One United Kingdom","H",NA
"The DUP is committed to a deal that works for the whole of the United Kingdom and which does not leave Northern Ireland behind.","601.1",NA
"We have been clear that without change, we would not vote for the Prime Minister’s agreement.","305.1",NA
"These proposals, as currently framed, are not in Northern Ireland’s longer-term interests, and they are clearly without support within Unionism.","305.1",NA
"In the last Parliament, it was the votes of the DUP that altered the course of events.","305.1",NA
"When tested the DUP stood strong.","305.1",NA
"In our view without change in key areas it would be bad for Northern Ireland economically.","305.1",NA
"The Articles of Union, the founding document, was not only about a constitutional Union but a trade and economic one as well.","403",NA
"There must be unfettered access for Northern Ireland to and from the Great Britain market.","403",NA
"The customs and consent arrangements must be revisited.","410",NA
"The one-sided approval mechanism for the Assembly takes no account of power sharing.","301",NA
"Furthermore, the East-West checks as proposed would lead to excessively bureaucratic burdens for trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland,","403",NA
"and consequentially higher prices and less choice for consumers as GB businesses opt for ‘not available in Northern Ireland’.","403",NA
"Northern Ireland trades far more with Great Britain than it does with the Republic of Ireland, European Union and rest of the world combined.","403",NA
"Yet the proposals put forward would see our East-West trade subject to the rules of the EU Customs Union, notwithstanding that Northern Ireland would remain part of the UK customs territory.","403",NA
"The DUP will continue to work to shape a solution in Northern Ireland’s interests.","410",NA
"The prism through which the DUP will judge each situation and vote is what is best for Northern Ireland economically and constitutionally within the Union.","601.1",NA

"The DUP supports: The UK target of 0.7% of Gross National Income (GNI) being dedicated to Foreign Aid.","107",NA
"The target should be on a 5-year rolling basis.","107",NA
"The annual nature of the spending target can mean substantial amounts of money being allocated in short-time frames and poorly spent.","107",NA
"This maintains the commitment and ensures better value for money.","107",NA

"The integrated nature of our economy reinforces the need to work together and work well.","501",NA
"Therefore, we believe a national approach to environmental protection is what is needed.","501",NA

"This will provide the best use of resources, access to highest expertise, best crisis management and a consistency of approach.","303",NA
"Northern Ireland has led the way in the United Kingdom in reducing the use of plastic bags through the levy","501",NA

"If poorly planned and implemented, these shifts in all aspects of our lives can have a disproportionately negative impact on poorer sections of the community and poorer regions of the UK.","503",NA
"With higher levels of poverty and presently one of the less well-developed regions of the United Kingdom, this means it is vital for Northern Ireland that: The national commitment is implemented fairly and properly resourced.","503",NA
"The transition and transformation this involves must be a just one for poorer sections of the community and regions.","503",NA
"Same Distance Travelled","H",NA
"Each constituent part of the United Kingdom’s work on climate action must be based on the distinct opportunities and challenges they face.","501",NA
"The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) recognises this and has recommended different targets for the four constituent parts of the UK that would still enable the nation to achieve its Net Zero target.","501",NA
"The same distance travelled in each part of the UK will deliver the national target but not require a common local target everywhere.","501",NA
"It must be recognised that Northern Ireland is the UK region with the greatest distance to travel and sectors that will be the most difficult to transform.","501",NA
"In the recent CCC report on Net Zero, it recommended a target for Northern Ireland of 78-80% reduction in CO2 by 2050.","501",NA
"However, with no Assembly or Executive it has never been asked for a formal recommendation.","501",NA
"The DUP will: Support a Northern Ireland Executive request for a formal recommendation from the CCC on a CO2 2050 target.","501",NA

"Cleaner Transport and Cleaner Air","H",NA

"A Diesel Scrappage Scheme targeted at cities and regions adopting Ultra Low Emission Zones or where diesel ownership levels are greater than 30% of domestic vehicles.","501",NA
"Require the installation, checking and cleaning of particulate matter filters on all petrol cars through the annual Ministry of Transport (MOT) test.","501",NA
"This is a very low-cost measure.","501",NA
"The development of a national Compressed National Gas Fuel network for HGVs, buses and coaches.","501",NA
"A New Long-Term National Defence Approach","H",NA
"The DUP does not believe that the current defence arrangements for the United Kingdom are adequate enough to cope with either the existing or the emerging threats of the 21st Century.","104",NA
"It is clear from the decision-making of the Ministry of Defence that they do not have confidence in its own Defence and National Security Reviews.","104",NA
"Part of our Confidence and Supply Agreement was a commitment to the UK maintaining the NATO target of 2% of GDP for the Defence Budget.","104",NA
"However, this was always a minimum target, a floor not a ceiling, and 2% is significantly below the traditional proportion of GDP that the UK has spent on defence.","104",NA
"While the public discussion has focused on the impact of public spending restrictions over the last decade defence has seen a steady reduction over 30 years.","104",NA
"The result is the British military industrial complex is no longer in a position to reconstitute large numbers of manpower or materiel to meet the needs of a national crisis.","104",NA
"Therefore, Defence needs to embark on a medium-term strategy of enhanced investment to restore the size of our Armed Forces to a position that more accurately reflects the threats we face and the strategic ambition","104",NA
"to retain P5 status at the UN and play a leading role in NATO.","104",NA
"We must always retain the capacity to operate independently in the national interest when required","104",NA
"whilst ensuring that we offer credible support to our key strategic ally, the US, and other partners.","101",NA
"Conflicts in the Middle East, instability in Eastern Europe, international terrorism and the proliferation of cyber-attacks illustrate the multiplicity of threats, both conventional and unconventional, and not just from states but also trans-national groups of linked terror movements.","104",NA
"This is further exacerbated by the displacements of large numbers of refugees within which small numbers of those with malevolent intent seek to hide.","104",NA
"This places additional burdens on the defence, security and intelligence apparatus of the country.","104",NA
"There is an ever-greater need to strengthen the ability of our forces to deploy rapidly and to adapt to new threats.","104",NA
"The dissident Republican terrorist threat is a major concern to all our citizens in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.","605.1",NA
"The intelligence community and our security forces must be given a budget and rules of engagement that enable them not only to gather the intelligence required to deter the threat from Republican splinter groups but also to actively pursue such terrorists and defeat them.","605.1",NA
"This is the DUP’s Plan to strengthen the UK’s defences and support service personnel and veterans.","606.1",NA
"1. National strategic defence & security review","H",NA
"Post-Brexit, the UK must reconsider its strategic position in terms of Defence and Security.","104",NA
"Government needs to give a clear strategic vision of the UK’s place in the world and our strategic aims and ambitions.","104",NA
"A Review needs to be conducted, independent of government, in order that we have an honest assessment of our current capability and capacity.","104",NA
"That will generate a clear indication of the ‘gap’ between what we need to do and what we are currently able to do.","104",NA
"Then decisions can be taken about the level of funding required to close the ‘gap’ or the level of risk Government is willing to take on National Security.","104",NA
"2. 2% plus spending target – A new UK target for Defence spending","H",NA
"The National Strategic Defence and Security Review would be the basis to establish a new UK defence spending, a target we call ‘2% plus’ to plan for systematic defence spending increases.","104",NA
"In addition to this new target there should be a long-term (5 year) capital settlement for equipment needs of the Armed Forces.","104",NA
"This will enable better planning, sustainable defence contracts and as a result greater value for money.","104",NA
"3. Full implementation of the Armed Forces Covenant across the United Kingdom","H",NA
"Northern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom with both an immense contribution to, and debt to, our Armed Forces for the protection they provided in the successful execution of Operation Banner.","104",NA
"This is partly why fulfilling the Military Covenant is particularly important for us.","104",NA
"We believe that the Military Covenant should be reviewed and updated.","104",NA
"The DUP supports the introduction of the Office for Veterans Affairs to co-ordinate cross government efforts to ensure the Covenant is fully implemented.","104",NA
"The DUP is conscious how equality legislation in Northern Ireland has been used to hamper the fulfilment of both the spirit and the practical elements of the Covenant here.","104",NA
"It wishes to see this situation ended and veterans in Northern Ireland to be treated equally to veterans right across the United Kingdom.","104",NA
"The DUP also believes that British military veterans living in the Republic of Ireland should also have unfettered access to the benefits of the Covenant.","104",NA
"For serving soldiers the DUP supports the recommendation of the Defence Select Committee to remove Crown Protection to force action to reduce deaths in training.","104",NA
"4. Maintaining our independent nuclear deterrent, and tackling nuclear proliferation","H",NA
"The DUP supports the UK’s independent nuclear deterrent and will continue to support Trident’s renewal.","104",NA
"We believe the UK should use all international forums to completely overhaul the approaches to counter proliferation and prevent the likes of Iran and North Korea developing and further proliferating such capabilities.","104",NA
"We believe that all of the funding of the nuclear deterrent programme should be ring-fenced outside of the Defence budget, recognising the unique nature of this National critical strategic asset.","104",NA
"5. Playing a full role in international military and security relationships","H",NA
"The DUP supports our participation in NATO","104",NA
"but shares the American concerns that other members are consistently failing to fulfil the minimum spending target.","104",NA
"The development of the European Union Defence Force attempts to hide this chronic underinvestment,","110",NA
"and contributes to incoherent responses to threats already dealt with by existing international structures such as NATO and the United Nations.","104",NA
"6. A Cybersecurity leader for the United Kingdom","H",NA
"Cyber activity continues to evolve as a dominant threat to global security.","104",NA
"The knowledge economy in Northern Ireland has developed a cybersecurity specialism and DUP believes this is a critical area where Northern Ireland could contribute to countering the growing threat to national and global security.","104",NA
"We support the expansion of cybersecurity research and the creation of a National Cyber Security ‘hub’ in Northern Ireland.","104",NA
"7. Investing in a success story – Northern Ireland and Reserve Forces","H",NA
"The contribution and role of Reserve Forces is a key element of Defence capability.","104",NA
"Northern Ireland’s contribution to UK reserves is disproportionate to our size and this contribution needs to be matched by the necessary investment in facilities and infrastructure in Northern Ireland.","104",NA
"The DUP wants a £15m investment package to upgrade reserve training facilities at Ballykinler, Enniskillen, Ballymena, Coleraine, Londonderry and Belfast.","104",NA
"As recognition of past service the DUP will support: A new Combined Military Museum for Northern Ireland in partnership with national museums to develop a prestigious tourist attraction.","104",NA
"8. A review of the present terrorism legislation","H",NA
"The DUP believes that considering the multifaceted evolving and insidious nature of the terrorist threat it is time to review whether present arrangements need to be updated or upgraded.","605.1",NA
"This review should include: An updated legal framework for intelligence led anti-terrorism investigations and operations in the UK","605.1",NA
"A UK wide definition of a victim which excludes perpetrators.","605.1",NA
"Changes to the glorification of terrorism offences with an examination of the 20-year time limit.","605.1",NA
"Consideration of Intelligence and Security Committee membership representing all regions of the UK","605.1",NA
"9. Legal Protections for Soldiers and Veterans","H",NA
"The fundamental failures of the Iraq Historical Investigations Team (IHAT) and the disproportionate focus upon security personnel in Legacy Investigations demonstrate a clear need to provide better protections for those who saw active service or contributed to the fight against terrorism.","104",NA
"With IHAT veterans hounded on a series of false allegations and in Northern Ireland Legacy Cases almost all security force related deaths are being reinvestigated while only a fraction of paramilitary killings have been.","104",NA
"The Defence Select Committee proposed a Qualified Statute of Limitations.","104",NA
"The DUP recognises the importance of all service personnel upholding the very highest standards in order to maintain the reputation of the forces and the colleagues they serve alongside.","104",NA
"We are supportive in principle of exploring protections for the armed forces where they would not lead to an amnesty or be restricted to operations outside the United Kingdom.","104",NA
"10. Valuing Soldiers’ Service","H",NA
"The condition and maintenance of much Army housing is unacceptable. Decent housing provision for Service personnel and their families should be the minimum not the target.","104",NA
"The DUP supports: A new long-term plan for Army housing and maintenance of stock.","104",NA
"Armed Forces Personnel, born outside the United Kingdom, should be welcomed when they choose to settle in the UK.","104",NA
"The DUP supports: Waiving indefinite leave to remain fees for former service personnel and their families applying to take up their right to settle here.","104",NA
"11. Resisting attempts to rewrite the past.","H",NA
"Ninety percent of those who died during the Troubles were killed by paramilitaries yet the balance of investigations is disproportionately against former police officers and soldiers.","601.1",NA
"A one-sided approach only serves those who want to re-write the past and glorify terrorism.","601.1",NA
"It is only natural that the public are outraged to see former soldiers who stood against the brutal terrorism of the seventies and eighties instigated by the IRA, now being hounded while those who hid behind balaclavas to avoid justice are given ‘hero’ status and places on Policing Boards.","601.1",NA
"Our troubled past can only be dealt with effectively in an honest and holistic manner, not the partial way republicans would wish.","601.1",NA
"Government needs to ensure terrorists are pursued, with full police powers to conduct effective and comprehensive investigations and arrest suspects.","605.1",NA
"We will do everything we can to assist innocent victims to obtain a measure of justice.","503",NA
"12. Bringing Armed Forces Day to Northern Ireland","H",NA
"It is unacceptable that Northern Ireland has never hosted the main national event for Armed Forces Day in the UK.","601.1",NA
"The DUP wish to see Northern Ireland host the main national event at some point in the life of the next Parliament and regularly thereafter.","601.1",NA
"It would be a welcome addition to a programme of events to celebrate Northern Ireland’s Centenary in 2021.","601.1",NA
"Next Generation Unionism","H",NA
"With Northern Ireland’s centenary less than two years away, we are seeking to develop a long-term vision for Unionism and Northern Ireland beyond 2021.","601.1",NA
"The Northern Ireland of today differs markedly to how it was at the founding of the state back in 1921, or compared to 1971, or even since the Belfast and St Andrews Agreements.","601.1",NA

"Our world feels much smaller as the result of more accessible travel and greater connectivity.","601.1",NA
"The UK has changed and continues to change, as does the Republic of Ireland.","601.1",NA
"The inherent strength of the United Kingdom has been its ability to evolve.","601.1",NA
"It has consistently achieved the balance between change and abiding by the founding principles of the Acts of Union.","601.1",NA
"As we leave the European Union,","110",NA
"it is time again to discuss the next steps in how we develop the United Kingdom, strengthen the institutions and traditions that bind us","601.1",NA

"We envisage a new body or structure that would have a wealth of opportunities for research, education, advocacy, media, conferences and exhibitions.","601.1",NA
"Cultural connections could be a key part of its work.","502",NA
"National Access to our National Cultural Wealth National cultural institutions have become less London centric but they remain too England centric","502",NA
"Access to our national cultural wealth is not enjoyed equally, and what practical barriers do exist do not justify this.","503",NA
"The DUP supports a new National Cultural Wealth Plan to increase touring exhibitions, display artefacts in other national museums and create shared exhibition space across the UK for the likes of the Imperial War Museum, V&A or Tate Gallery to place long and short-term exhibitions.","502",NA
