"Introduction to Our ManifestoSuzanne Evans Deputy Chair, Policy//At the last general election, leaving the European Union was UKIP’s dream. //When we produced the UK’s first ever fully costed and independently verified manifesto, we outlined a vision of how strong and democratic Britain could be if we grasped the opportunity to become an independent, sovereign nation once again. //  Now, Article 50 has been triggered, and we dare to believe our dream will become reality within the next two years. //UKIP sets out in this manifesto six ‘Brexit Tests’ which need to be passed before we can say we are finally free of the EU. // Whoever forms the next government must take note. //While some parties tear up their previous manifestos, UKIP is a party that likes to stick to its principles. // The £35 billion we will use to finance our public spending priorities has again come from reasonable cuts to the foreign aid budget, // scrapping HS2, // amending the Barnett Formula// and the savings we will make in two years’ time by leaving the EU. // For the second general election in a row, UKIP’s spending proposals do not involve raising any taxes. //UKIP’s policies have been developed not to catch the public imagination – although we think they will – but to deliver what Britain really needs// and what we can afford. // These are our spending priorities for the next parliament: Invest an extra £11 billion every year into the NHS and social care by the end of the next parliament, //raising caps on medical school and nurse training places, // and increasing funding for mental health and dementia//•Raise the threshold for paying income tax to £13,500, // cut taxes for middle earners, // abolish the TV licence //and cut VAT on household bills//•Scrap tuition fees for science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine students//•Provide up to 100,000 new homes for younger people every year//•Maintain all pensioner benefits and the pensions Triple Lock//•Protect disability and carer’s benefits//•Spend a genuine two per cent of GDP on defence, plus £1 billion every year//•Fund 20,000 more police officers, // 7,000 more prison officers, // and 4,000 more border force staff //•Revive our coastal communities and fishing villages//•Cut Business Rates for the smallest businesses//•Commission a dedicated hospital ship to assist our armed forces// and deliver humanitarian medical assistance worldwide//Then there are the policies that only UKIP is prepared to commit to: reducing net migration to zero, // putting integration at the top of the political agenda, // abolishing the House of Lords// and creating an English parliament. //Our country needs radical social, // economic, // and democratic change. // Brexit heralds a huge potential to shake things up, //but it will take a political party like UKIP to stand up to the tyranny of the status quo, // if we are really to pull Britain Together.",NA,NA
"Brexit Britain: The Key Tests","H",NA
"UKIP has set out six key Brexit tests and until each one of them has been met, we will not have the Brexit the British people voted for on  23rd June last year.","110",NA
"One of the most crucial tests is regaining the fishing rights Britain has under international law.","703.1",NA
"The Conservatives already look to be backsliding on this.","703.1",NA
"More than 17 million of us voted ‘Leave,’ giving the government the largest democratic mandate in the history of  British politics. There should be no question of turning back, yet the Tories are leaving the door to the EU wide open. UKIP is the only party that will genuinely respect the referendum result. Gerard Batten MEP, Brexit Spokesman",NA,NA
"UKIP believes the UK should have already left the EU, and that following the Article 50 process will lead us to make too many concessions to Brussels.","110",NA
"Theresa May has already shown signs of capitulating on key issues such as immigration","601.2",NA
"and freeing the UK from the jurisdiction of the European Courts.","110",NA
"What concessions will she make next?","305.2",NA
"Theresa May should not be allowing the EU to influence how, when, and on what terms we leave.","305.2",NA
"Ours is a position of inherent strength, and we should be acting from that position of strength, not giving up before negotiations have even begun.","601.1",NA
"HOW BRITAIN COULD, AND STILL SHOULD, LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION","H",NA
"Repealing the European Communities Act (1972) should be the first, not the last step in the leaving process.","110",NA
"There is no legal or moral obligation to use Article 50; we have the legal right to withdraw from the EU unilaterally.","110",NA
"Article 50 is a trap designed to obstruct countries from leaving the EU.","110",NA
"The longer the leaving process lasts, the greater the chance of the Referendum decision being overturned.","202.4",NA
"May’s decision not to implement the decision of the Referendum as quickly as possible, but follow a slow route that suits the EU, is very worrying.","305.2",NA
"By repealing the 1972 Act we could immediately take back control of key policy areas such as immigration and border controls,","601.2",NA
"fishing,","703.1",NA
"farming,","703.1",NA
"trade,","407",NA
"security and defence,","104",NA
"and police and criminal justice.","605.1",NA
"All EU laws could remain in place temporarily, until they are repealed individually, amended , or allowed to stand.","110",NA
"THE OPEN DOOR TO THE 2019 EU ELECTIONS","H",NA
"By now, a Bill for the repeal of the European Elections Act (2002) should have been placed before parliament, to ensure no British national can stand for election to the European Parliament in 2019.","110",NA
"This would have been a clear sign that there is no going back on Brexit, yet this has not happened.","110",NA
"THE EU PLAN TO STOP US LEAVING","H",NA
"Article 50 is not just a two-year process, as it makes provision for negotiations to extend for an indefinite time beyond that.","110",NA
"We are likely to find ourselves facing protracted and tortuous negotiations with a recalcitrant, bullying EU for quite some time.","110",NA
"The EU has no incentive to negotiate a ‘good deal’ for the UK because it does not want us to leave.","110",NA
"The UK has massive exposure to the liabilities of the European Central Bank, the European Investment Bank, and various other ‘financial mechanisms’ of the EU so long as we remain a member.","110",NA
"We will be expected to contribute to any Eurozone bailouts.","110",NA
"The EU will also have to plug a huge financial hole of some 12 per cent of the gross EU budget when Britain leaves.","110",NA
"These are just two very good reasons for the EU to keep us dangling on the hook for as long as possible.","110",NA
"The longer the EU can keep Britain in, the greater the opportunity for a new government to reverse the referendum decision, or sign up to some kind of associated membership agreement which, to all intents and purposes, will be just like EU membership.","110",NA
"THERE MUST BE NO COMPROMISE ON BREXIT","H",NA
"Our government and our parliament should implement the referendum decision according to our own requirements, and then agree the terms of our separation.","601.1",NA
"If Theresa May signs a withdrawal agreement which means we will leave in name but not in substance, she will have betrayed Britain to the EU, just as every Prime Minister has done since 1972.","110",NA
"The fact that the political class is choosing to dance to Brussels’ tune proves UKIP is the only political party in Britain you can trust to deliver a true, unequivocal Brexit.","110",NA
"Once we have left the EU, we will not allow the EU flag to be flown from public buildings.",NA,NA
"We will declare 23rd June Independence Day, and make it a bank holiday.",NA,NA
"Our SIX Brexit Tests","H",NA
"Only when the government has passed all these tests can we be sure the British people have got the deal they voted for on June 23rd 2016:","202.4",NA
"1 THE LEGAL TEST","H",NA
"Parliament must resume its supremacy of law-making without restriction.","202.1",NA
"Britain must be completely free from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice,","110",NA
"and we must be free, if we wish, to relinquish our membership of the European Court of Human Rights.","110",NA
"2 THE MIGRATION TEST","H",NA
"Britain must have full control of immigration and asylum policies,","601.2",NA
"and border control.","601.2",NA
"We must be not be bound by any freedom of movement obligation,","601.2",NA
"and we must be free to set and meet our own annual migration targets.","601.2",NA
"3 THE MARITIME TEST","H",NA
"The UK’s full maritime sovereignty must be restored and we must have control of our maritime exclusive economic zone, which stretches 200 miles off the coast or to the half-way point between the UK and neighbouring countries.","110",NA
"There must be no constraints on our fishing fleet other than those decided upon by the UK parliament.","703.1",NA
"4 THE TRADE TEST","H",NA
"The UK must retake its seat on the World Trade Organisation and resume its sovereign right to sign trade agreements with other entities or supra-national bodies.","407",NA
"We must have full rights to set our own tariff and non-tariff barriers consistent with WTO rules,","406",NA
"and we must have left both the EU single market and the customs union.","110",NA
"5 THE MONEY TEST","H",NA
"We must not pay any ‘divorce’ payment to the EU, nor contribute to the EU budget.","110",NA
"We must have been paid our share of financial assets from entities such as the European Investment Bank, in which some £9 billion of UK money is vested.","110",NA
"6 THE TIME TEST","H",NA
"Brexit must be done and dusted before the end of 2019.","110",NA
"“Our fishing industry could be worth £6.3 billion when we leave the EU. Free of the Common Fisheries Policy, we can take back full control of the seas up to 200 miles from our coast, as is our right under international law. We can start to rebuild the once- flourishing fishing industry that our membership of the EU destroyed.”",NA,NA
"Mike Hookem MEP,",NA,NA
"Fishing Spokesman",NA,NA
"RESTORING BRITAIN’S FISHING INDUSTRY","H",NA
"Of all the tests for a ‘proper’ Brexit, taking back control of our fisheries is key.","703.1",NA
"The EU’s Common Fisheries Policy is an environmental, economic and social disaster that has devastated fishing communities","703.1",NA
"and caused catastrophic damage to our maritime ecology.","703.1",NA
"Until we have control of our seas and our fish stocks, we do not have Brexit.","703.1",NA
"The EU’s Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) was cobbled together in 1970 as Denmark, Ireland, Norway and the UK were on course to join the then EEC.","703.1",NA
"Together, these countries held 90 per cent of Western European fish stocks.","703.1",NA
"80 per cent of those stocks were British.","703.1",NA
"It was a cynical but legal way to seize the new entrants’ precious marine resources.","703.1",NA
"The central tenet of the CFP, that there should be non-negotiable ‘equal access’ to EEC/EU waters was a condition of EEC/EU membership,","703.1",NA
"Some say Prime Minister Edward Heath committed an act of treachery when he capitulated to the CFP; certainly he allowed the UK’s territorial waters to be plundered by industrialised fishing fleets, which led to huge job and tax revenue losses from fishing and ancillary industries.","703.1",NA
"The CFP has rightly been described as an obscenity because of its reckless fishing quotas and the discard policy.","703.1",NA
"This requires fishermen either to throw back into the seas dead fish caught over quota, or to bring them back to port and send them to landfill.","703.1",NA
"Data on discards from Eurostat show discards equate to some two billion fish suppers thrown back into the sea every year.","703.1",NA
"It is environmental and economic madness.","416.2",NA
"Once we leave the EU, we can also leave the CFP, take back control of our seas, and rebuild our fishing industry.","703.1",NA
"THE 1964 LONDON CONVENTION ON FISHING","H",NA
"UKIP will repeal this little-known convention, an agreement between twelve European nations and the UK, which recognises the historic fishing rights of vessels from the contracting parties to fish in the band of waters between six and twelve nautical miles from the UK coast.","703.1",NA
"When the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy ceases to apply, the UK will automatically establish controlof a 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone giving our fishermen sole access to the seas within 200 miles of the UK coastline, or at the mid-point between two countries’ coastlines.","703.1",NA
"However, the existence of the pre-EU 1964 Convention could offer a back door to continued EU fishing in British waters, as vessels belonging to signatory nations could cite this legislation and claim ‘historic rights’ to fishing within the 6 to 12 nautical mile band around the UK.","703.1",NA
"The next government’s willingness - or otherwise - to revoke the 1964 London Convention on Fishing could be indicative of their intentions for the fishing industry in the post-Brexit era.","703.1",NA
"Article 15 of the Convention calls for a two-year notice period, so time is of the essence, yet to date no action has been taken.","703.1",NA
"SECURING THE FUTURE OF OUR FISHERIES","H",NA
"Re-building our fishing industry and repatriating one of our nation’s greatest renewable resources will take time but it could be worth as much as £6.3 billion to the UK economy in net-to-plate income alone.","703.1",NA
"This is a golden opportunity for Britain: our fisheries must not be used as a bargaining chip in EU exit negotiations","703.1",NA
"To take back full control of our fisheries, UKIP will: Leave the CFP and withdraw from the 1964 London convention","703.1",NA
"•Restore the UK Exclusive Economic Zone in accordance with international law","703.1",NA
"•End the obscenity of discards and make best use of all fish caught","703.1",NA
"•Introduce a time-limited, paid licence fee option for selected foreign vessels to fish within the UK’s territorial waters, while the UK fishing industry re-establishes itself","703.1",NA
"•Launch an inclusive, collaborative consultation with the fishing community to draft a new Fisheries Bill","703.1",NA
"•Ensure all fish caught within UK waters, including those taken by foreign vessels operating under licence, are landed and sold in the UK, to help finance and attract investment in the newly developing UK fishing industry","703.1",NA
"•Create, train and equip a new Fisheries Protection Force, using a mixture of technologies in sea-and land-based methods, to police the UK’s Exclusive Economic Zone.","703.1",NA
"In addition to the economic, environmental, and social gains we will make in restoring our fishing industry, Brexit also offers a unique opportunity to regenerate British boat and shipbuilding.","411",NA
"We could develop our civil ship and boat building programme in line with the World Trade Organisation’s Trade Related Technical Assistance programme.","411",NA
"Brexit Britain offers a host of opportunities, and nowhere more so than in our fishing industry.","703.1",NA
"Reviving our proud and profitable maritime tradition will rejuvenate our seaside towns,","703.1",NA
"enhance our coastline,","703.1",NA

"and secure the future for British fishermen.","703.1",NA
"The British PassportIn 1988, the blue British passport was scrapped and replaced by a smaller burgundy EU one, a clear step towards the creation of a United States of Europe.

"Reducing the tax burden on working people in the bottom and middle ranges of the income scale is our priority.","701",NA

"UKIP’s policy is to introduce a flexible state pension window, so everyone can opt to retire earlier, for a slightly lower state pension, or work longer for a slightly higher pension, as is the case at the moment.","504",NA
"We will allow women to retire on this basis at 60, if they so wish.","504",NA
"Time and again you will see the Conservative Party giving favourable treatment to the rich and powerful and dumping on the up-and-comers. It is not an attractive trait.

"“Starbucks recently reported profits of £13.4m on a UK turnover of £380m. Its corporation tax contribution fell to £2.7m, down from £7m the year before. How can a vast business that sells coffee in paper cups all over the country for £2.50 a pop end up paying a corporation tax contribution amounting to much less than one per cent of turnover? Would the taxman be happy to accept, pro-rata, such a contribution from an independent coffee shop? I think we know the answer to that.”",NA,NA

"The waiting list for public and affordable housing stands at 1.2 million alone.","504",NA
"UKIP will provide high quality, affordable homes, with security of tenure, where they are needed,","504",NA
"while boosting jobs.","701",NA
"Successive governments have failed to meet the housing needs of an increasing population.","504",NA
"Of the 140,000 homes due to be built this year, 80,000 will be absorbed by population growth, exacerbated by immigration, so at best only 60,000 will begin to address the current chronic shortage.","504",NA
"Labour, the Conservatives, and other parties in this election will promise to build hundreds of thousands of new homes, but their plans are not credible.","305.1",NA
"There are not enough workers in the traditional construction industry to meet their targets.","411",NA
"Planning permission remains slow and difficult to obtain and developers have no incentive to build more, because under-supply boosts their margins and land bank values.","402",NA
"UKIP is the only party being realistic about what can be done to increase the housing supply and putting forward a viable solution: a bold policy to roll out high quality, low cost factory-built modular (FBM) homes, affordable on the national average wage of £26,000.","504",NA
"LOCALLY MANUFACTURED FACTORY-BUILT MODULAR HOMES","H",NA
"Factory-built homes should not be confused with the pre-fabs of the past.","411",NA
"They are built to last, to high design standards,","411",NA
"and are energy efficient, with running costs up to 30per cent less than traditional homes.","411",NA
"While conventional construction cannot in the medium term meet the need for low cost housing, factory-built modular homes can.","411",NA
"When we leave the EU, we will regain control of the regional development budget, over £1 billion a year.","411",NA
"UKIP will use some of this to boost capacity in UK-based modular homes manufacturing.","411",NA
"We will enable the manufacture of modular homes where jobs are needed,","701",NA
"and they will be built where homes are needed.","504",NA
"UKIP’s housing policy provides a solution to the housing crisis, which requires no direct funding from government, and is not constrained by the current skill-shortage in the construction industry. It is a radical and visionary plan. Finally, our young people will be able to afford their own homes.",NA,NA
"Ray Finch MEP,",NA,NA
"Housing Spokesman",NA,NA
"HOW UKIP’S MODULAR HOMES BUILDING SCHEME WILL WORK","H",NA
"UKIP will establish a Housing Development Corporation (HDC) to acquire primarily brownfield sites – at existing use value and through compulsory purchase if necessary – where affordable housing is required.","504",NA
"Planning law will be changed to enable the HDC to give themselves planning permission to build between 10 and 100 FBM homes on an average site.","411",NA
"Homes constructed will be sold on a freehold basis to first time buyers up to the age of 40 who are British citizens and who have a 10 per cent deposit.","404",NA
"We anticipate the total cost for a two-bedroom house will be under £100,000, including land purchase and restoration, construction, infrastructure and a contribution to the costs of the HDC.","411",NA
"Utilities installation would be covered by a 1 per cent energy bill levy,","416.2",NA
"and Stamp Duty would not be applied.","403",NA
"UKIP’s proposal will bring up to 100,000 extra truly affordable homes onto the market every year.","504",NA
"Combined with a traditional home building programme, we could build another one million homes by 2022.","504",NA
"In addition, the FBM model would also make it feasible to deliver substantial numbers of new Council houses that have been promised, while traditional methods do not.","411",NA
"RESTRICTIONS ON USE AND RESALE","H",NA
"As this scheme is a stepping¬stone from the rental sector to traditional home ownership, to address the current housing crisis, it must not distort the existing property market.","403",NA
"So, homes will be for owner occupation, not private rental.","403",NA
"Owners will not be able to sell them on the open market, but must sell them back to the HDC at a guaranteed price of cost plus inflation over the period of ownership.","403",NA
"Ownership can, however, be retained indefinitely.","403",NA
"THE HOUSING CRISIS SOLVED","H",NA
"UKIP’s modular home scheme provides: High quality homes with security of tenure, where they are needed","411",NA
"•A way for the next generation to build up equity and move into the traditional home owner market","503",NA
"•A realistic way of building homes that is not constrained by the current skills shortage in the construction industry","411",NA
"Words and gimmicks from the old political parties will not solve the housing crisis.","305.1",NA
"UKIP’s bold plan will.","305.1",NA
"GOING OVER AND ABOVE","H",NA
"In addition to our FBM homes programme, UKIP will identify long-term dormant land held by central and local government so it can be released for affordable developments.","504",NA
"We will alsoplough all revenue raisedfrom Right to Buy sales into community housing","504",NA
"and change the law to allow mortgages to become inheritable, as they are in other countries.","408",NA
"A REVIEW OF HOUSING ASSOCIATIONS","H",NA
"Housing associations are accountable neither to taxpayers, who provide much of their funding, nor to their own tenants.","202.1",NA
"A UKIP investigation into the largest 50 housing associations uncovered a catalogue of failures.","303",NA
"They are not building as many homes as private developers,","303",NA
"the homes they do build cost more to put up,","303",NA
"and they are failing to tackle anti-social behaviour.","605.1",NA
"Average salaries for chief executives reach 51 times their tenants’ rent: one CEO is paid three times as much as the Prime Minister.","503",NA
"Housing associations manage 60 per cent of the socially rented sector and have received £23 billion of Government funding in the past 14 years, but UKIP is not convinced they are benefiting either tenants or the taxpayer.","303",NA
"We will launch a review into their operation.","303",NA
"Defending our National Health Service","H",NA
"THE NHS is Britain’s best-loved public service and one of the benchmarks of our civilised values.","504",NA
"UKIP will keep the NHS free at the point of delivery and increase funding by diverting the £11 billion we will save by cutting the foreign aid budget directly into health and social care.","504",NA
"Successive Labour, Coalition and Tory governments have overloaded the NHS with red tape","303",NA
"and allowed it to be abused as an international, rather than a National Health Service.","601.1",NA
"The NHS is funded by the British people and should be for the British people.","601.1",NA
"A catalogue of failures has left the NHS in crisis.","504",NA
"NHS Trusts are in deficit to the tune of £2.5 billion, hospital waiting lists for routine treatment have reached record highs, and tens of thousands of elective operations have been cancelled for non-clinical reasons.","504",NA
"In January this year 23 hospitals could not guarantee patient care or safety.","504",NA
"The Royal College of Nursing says we need 24,000 more nurses, and NHS Digital estimates there is roughly one GP vacancy for every two practices.","504",NA
"1,500 doctors leave Britain every year for better pay and more relaxed working conditions in Australia or New Zealand.","704",NA
"The NHS desperately needs additional funds.","504",NA
"UKIP will provide NHS England with an additional £9 billion a year by 2021/22.","504",NA
"An additional £2 billion for social care will fully utilise the savings we will make from the foreign aid budget.","504",NA
"MORE MEDICAL STUDENTS, DOCTORS, GPS, NURSES, AND MIDWIVES","H",NA
"Despite our national doctor shortage, nearly 800 straight ‘A’ students are turned away from medical school every year.","504",NA
"UKIP will lift the cap on medical school training places from 7,500 to 10,000 and make sure nosuitable ‘A’ grade student fails to get a place.","504",NA
"Provided medical students commit to working within the NHS for at least ten out of the fifteen years after they qualify, we will cover the cost of all their tuition fees.","504",NA
"TACKLING THE GP SHORTAGE","H",NA
"Raising the cap on medical school places will help deliver the 10,000 additional GPs the profession needs by 2025.","504",NA
"We will also introduce new funding arrangements incentivising doctors to work in geographical areas most in need.","504",NA
"However, GPs are also grappling with heavy workloads and over-regulation.","504",NA
"We will end appraisal and revalidation work that goes beyond that deemed necessary by the GMC,","504",NA
"and reduce the burden of data collection and target chasing.","303",NA
"UKIP will also fund the cost of streamlined ‘return to practice’ training, and encourage retired GPs or GPs with small children to work part-time or in job-share schemes.","504",NA
"For doctors who have worked overseas, we will make re-registering with the UK General Medical Council much easier by recognising comparable qualifications, experience, and accreditation.","504",NA
"Introducing a wider rangeof healthcare professionals and clinical services into GPsurgeries will also make general practice less stressful.","504",NA
"We will fund additionalsupport staff such as physician associates, clinical pharmacists and health visitors in GP surgeries, and allow practices to operate a wider range of clinics, including minor surgery, where feasible.","504",NA
"GIVING NURSES THE RESPECT AND RECOGNITION THEY DESERVE","H",NA
"The NHS needs 24,000 more nurses and 3,500 more midwives, yet again potential students are being turned away, tens of thousands of them every year.","504",NA
"UKIP will increase the number of nurse training placements,","411",NA
"reinstate funding for bursaries to cover nursing, midwifery and allied health professions’ tuition and accommodation costs,","504",NA

"RELIEVING PRESSURE ON A&E DEPARTMENTS","H",NA
"UKIP will train more emergency medicine consultants","411",NA
"and improve their working conditions.","701",NA
"Emergency medicine consultants cannot be expected to work unreasonably extended shifts, repeated unsocial hours, excessive numbers of weekends, or be regularly forced to cancel leave.","701",NA
"Every part of the health sector has a role to play in reducing A&E traffic.","504",NA
"By improving access to and facilities in GP surgeries, keeping minor injuries units open, and sustaining funding levels for local chemists, we can start to address the A&E crisis.","504",NA
"“Labour and the Tories have failed the NHS with nine arduous top-down reorganisations since 1973 and a relentless cuts and privatisation agenda.

"Treating those ineligible for care costs British taxpayers around £2 billion every year.","601.2",NA

"ACCOUNTABLE MANAGEMENT","H",NA
"To improve standards within the NHS, we will create the equivalent of a General Medical Council for NHS managers, making them subject to disciplinary control for the first time.","504",NA
"Managers will require a statutory Licence to Manage.","504",NA
"Removal of this licence would immediately bar them from working as a manager anywhere within the NHS.","504",NA
"The wellbeing of staff is too important to allow incompetent, negligent or bullying managers to remain within the NHS.","504",NA
"Managers and board members will be held individually accountable for poor decisions.","202.1",NA
"Individual votes should be noted on significant or contentious matters.","202.1",NA
"We will limit the amount that can be spent on an external management consultancy contract to £50,000.","303",NA

"BANNING LABOUR’S DODGY NHS DEALS","H",NA
"Between 1997 and 2010, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown contracted private syndicates of hedge fund managers, bankers, and big property developers to design, build, and finance new hospitals and run non-clinical services.","304",NA
"These syndicates charged interest rates so high, you might as well have called the scheme: ‘buy one hospital, pay for seven.’","304",NA
"These Private Finance Initiative (PFI) deals financed £11.8 billion worth of new build but will ultimately cost the NHS £79 billion.","304",NA
"75 per cent of the syndicates involved are based offshore, so they do not even pay UK taxes on these enormous profits.","304",NA
"Labour is not the party of the NHS: Labour is the party that allowed the wealthiest in our society to laugh all the way to the bank at the expense of the NHS.","305.1",NA

"UKIP’s 2015 general election manifesto highlighted the complexity of childcare provision in the UK and how difficult it can be to find quality childcare, especially if your child is disabled, if you work irregular hours, or you are on a low income.","504",NA
"Despite an increase in free childcare provision and new tax-free childcare schemes, recent research from the Family and Childcare Trust revealed British parents now pay more than £6,000 per year on average for childcare, double what they spend on food and drink.","504",NA
"The situation we warned about in 2015 has not improved but got worse.","504",NA
"Perverse government policies intended to expand childcare provision fuel childcare demand yet fail to cover costs incurred by childcare providers.","504",NA
"At the same time there is an acute shortage of places because of over-regulation and higher training fees.","504",NA
"Nurseries and childminders limit places, raise fees, or introduce extra charges in order to remain sustainable.","504",NA
"Despite more public money being allocated to free childcare than ever, the number of childminders has plummeted by 10,000 since 2012.","504",NA
"This is a typical outcome of policy-making done via a ‘bidding war,’ instead of being thought through.","305.1",NA
"In this case, Labour and the Conservatives have jockeyed for position to see who can offer the highest number of free childcare hours for the youngest children, without considering the unintended consequences, or what else in the system might need to change.","504",NA
"UKIP promised a far-reaching review of childcare provision in 2015, and this is still urgently needed, not least to de-regulate and simplify an increasingly fragmented system.","303",NA
"Meanwhile, UKIP will allow parents to use their free childcare entitlements to access a greater choice of childcare providers by removing restrictions limiting them only to Ofsted-registered childcare providers.","504",NA

"The concerns we raised in 2015 about the Family Court system, particularly in relation to forced adoptions, have become more pressing.","603",NA
"Up to 96 per cent of children adopted from public care are forcibly adopted, against their parents’ wishes.","603",NA
"No one wants to see children languishing in care, but until the Family Courts are more transparent, we cannot know whether decisions are made in children’s best interests or in response to adoption targets.","304",NA
"The latter approach risks serious miscarriages of justice.","304",NA
"Maintaining confidentiality in family law proceedings is not incompatible with scrutiny.","603",NA
"To strike the right balance between the two we propose: Removing the current blanket ban on media reporting of placement and adoption proceedings and allowing journalists to report on such cases on the same basis as other family law proceedings","603",NA

"The number of adults eligible to receive social care has plummeted by 28 per cent.","504",NA
"This is counter-productive: the government says it wants to help older people stay active and independent, but then removes the support they need.","504",NA
"Most councils only fund those already in ‘critical’ or ‘substantial’ need and past the point of no return.","504",NA
"No wonder older people are now more likely to be admitted to hospital, and less likely to be able to leave hospital when they recover.","504",NA
"6,800 such patients every day cannot be discharged, so ambulances queue up outside A&E and planned operations are cancelled.","504",NA
"This inefficiency costs the NHS approximately £1 billion a year, and it could get worse.","504",NA
"Last year, research by BBC Radio 4’s You and Yours found 59 home care companies had already handed unprofitable contracts back to local authorities, and that one in four care homes may go out of business within three years.","504",NA
"The Better Care Fund was supposed to improve liaison between the NHS and local councils and ease pressure on hospitals, but the Public Accounts Committee found it was ‘little more than a ruse.’","504",NA
"The freedom to raise council tax by two per cent to fund adult social care is of least help to councils in the poorest areas, who have less income from council tax, but the most pressing care needs.","504",NA

"PIPs were supposed to help disabled people into work and pay a range of disability benefits based on individual need, but they seem to have become a covert way of slashing the benefit bill.","504",NA
"Since disabled people were required to undergo a new battery of medical tests, 250,000 of them have had their benefit cut.","504",NA
"Some 300 people a day who have their benefits cut following re¬assessments are appealing against these new decisions, at a cost of £1 million a week to the taxpayer.","303",NA

"Our approach to criminality contrasts starkly with that of the other parties.","605.1",NA
"As Home Secretary, Theresa May was soft on crime.","605.1",NA
"She went the way of the Labour party, putting the human rights of offenders before those of their victims, tiptoeing around even the most hardened criminals, instead of concentrating on protecting the public.","605.1",NA
"We will not tolerate a perverse criminal justice system that allows criminals to get away with serious crimes or repeat offending because the police are under-resourced.","605.1",NA

"UKIP thinks this is potentially disastrous: those who benefit most from prison are the law-abiding people who do not go.","605.1",NA
"We will keep all existing prisons open and continue with the current building programme.","605.1",NA
"We will send as many as possible of the 13,000 foreign nationals in our jails back to their home countries","601.2",NA

"In 2010, the new Conservative-led government began including the Single Intelligence Account, Armed Forces pensions and Trident in the defence budget, rather than accounting for them separately.","104",NA

"Cllr Lisa Duffy,",NA,NA
"Foreign Aid Spokeswoman",NA,NA
"A 2015 World Economic Forum study concluded that in the developing world there was ‘no effect of aid on growth,’ yet UKIP is the only party in this election offering voters a real choice when it comes to foreign aid spending.","109",NA
"The others all back spending 0.7 per cent of our Gross National Income (GNI), regardless of results.","109",NA
"When carefully targeted, aid can feed the poor and heal the sick, but regular aid payments may act as a disincentive to economic growth.","109",NA
"Between 1970 and 1998, when aid flows to Africa were at their peak, poverty in Africa worsened.","109",NA
"Despite receiving over £400 billion in aid over the past forty years, the continent remains poor.","109",NA
"It is time to consign to history the idea that pouring ever-greater sums into the foreign aid budget is a signal of our virtue.","109",NA
"It is a hangover from the era of celebrity-driven politics personified by Tony Blair and David Cameron.","109",NA
"In many cases, it can be demonstrated to be doing more harm than good.","109",NA
"Leaving the EU gives us the chance to boost the fortunes of developing countries by striking Free Trade Agreements with them.","407",NA
"UKIP will make ‘Transition to Trade’ offers to some of the biggest aid recipient nations as we gradually reduce the amount of UK taxpayers’ money we send to them.","407",NA

"We will repeal the law requiring us to spend 0.7 per cent of GNI on foreign aid","109",NA

"We will continue to fund projects that make a real difference: clean water programmes, childhood inoculations, medical assistance, and disaster and emergency relief.","107",NA

"Leaving the EU is not about becoming ‘little Englanders,’ it is about putting the ‘Great’ back into Great Britain.","601.1",NA
"It is about embracing new trading markets in all seven continents of the globe.","407",NA
"Naturally, we should like to agree a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the EU, and continue to trade on the same basis as at present.","407",NA
"As the UK is the EU’s largest single export market, the EU should want to reach a swift and sensible trade deal with us.","407",NA
"However, if the EU continues to make unreasonable demands in return for even talking about free trade, then we must be prepared to walk away.","110",NA
"In circumstances where the EU continues to insist Britain pay a huge ‘divorce’ settlement of up to €100 billion, or continues to demand we accept the on-going jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and allow the free movement of people, trading with the EU within the legal framework of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) would be the far better option.","110",NA
"Not having an FTA with the EU will not prevent our trading with EU businesses, so talk of a ‘cliff edge’ is pure hyperbole.","110",NA
"Neither could we ‘crash out’ of the EU, because trade is not going to stop, whatever happens.","407",NA
"It should also be remembered that the EU is itself a member of the WTO and subject to its rules, so therefore extremely limited in any hostile action it could take against Britain.","110",NA

"DEFENDING DIESEL DRIVERS","H",NA
"In the 1990s, the EU and our government promoted diesel vehicles, claiming they were more env ronmentally friendly because they produced less carbon dioxide.","304",NA
"Incentives such as higher taxes on petrol and cuts to Vehicle Excise Duty for diesel cars worked and diesel car ownership shot up.","304",NA
"The ‘experts,’ however, have changed their advice.","304",NA
"Policy has now U-turned.","304",NA
"Punitive taxes are being slapped on diesel cars and there are calls to ban them from city centres.","304",NA
"A scrappage scheme giving diesel car owners up to £2,000 to get rid of their vehicles has also been introduced, and UKIP supports this;","409",NA
"however, we will combine it with an incentive scheme encouraging drivers to exchange their vehicles for electric or hybrid models.","409",NA
"UKIP will prevent diesel drivers from being penalised through higher taxes, parking fees, or emissions’ zone charging.","403",NA

"UKIP has a clear commitment to secure, affordable energy for everyone. We will repeal the 2008 Climate Change Act, the most expensive piece of legislation in  history.

"Every political party except UKIP has thrown its weight behind the 2008 Climate Change Act.","000",NA
"Set to cost us an eye-watering £319 billion by 2030, this Act has no basis in science, and its aim of cutting greenhouse gases by 80 per cent by 2050 is unachievable.","000",NA
"It is a textbook exercise in legislative folly, brought about by nothing more than a competitive cross-party ‘dash for green.’","000",NA
"While our major global competitors in the USA, China and India are switching to low-cost fossil fuels, this Act forces us to close perfectly good coal-fired power stations to meet unattainable targets for renewable capacity.","411",NA

"Problems in the steel industry have been well publicised, but similar issues apply to aluminium, chemicals, fertilisers, glass, ceramics and petroleumrefining.","401",NA
"Such companies may move to countries with lower environmental standards, and increase emissions, thereby rendering the 2008 Act even more futile.","401",NA

"Are the decaying walls symptomatic of what is happening inside the mother of parliaments?","202.1",NA
"Government has become bloated and unmanageable.","303",NA
"Politics is corrupted by self-interest and big business.","304",NA
"An unaccountable elite revels in mutual back-scratching and cronyism.","304",NA
"If the best interests of the people of this country are to be well served, our current political system needs urgent reform.","202.1",NA
"UKIP believes it is time to make our nation truly democratic, and this is how we will do it.","202.1",NA
"PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION","H",NA
"All votes should matter, so we will introduce a voting system that genuinely reflects the will of the people as a whole.","202.1",NA
"In the 2015 general election, UKIP got 12.6 per cent of the vote but only one seat, while the SNP won just 4.7 percent of the national vote but took 56 seats.","202.1",NA
"The current First Past the Post (FPTP) system we use for electing MPs to our national parliament is bad for voters, bad for government, and bad for democracy.","202.1",NA
"UKIP wants a fairer, more proportional voting system that makes seats match votes, and ends the inbuilt advantage the establishment parties have over smaller parties.","202.1",NA
"A proportional electoral system that delivers a parliament representative of the number of votes cast, while retaining a constituency link, is one we strongly advocate.","202.1",NA
"SCRAP POSTAL VOTING ON DEMAND","H",NA
"Originally intended to increase voter turnout and enhance democracy, postal voting has had the opposite effect, fuelling “massive, systematic and organised fraud” that would “disgrace a banana republic,” according to England and Wales’s senior and most experienced Election Commissioner.","202.1",NA
"UKIP will reserve postal votes only for those who can show a genuine need.","202.1",NA
"Otherwise, voting must be done at polling stations.","202.1",NA
"ABOLISH THE HOUSE OF LORDS","H",NA
"It is time for the House of Lords to go.","202.1",NA
"Attempts at reform have proved counter¬productive.","202.1",NA
"The House of Lords Act 1999 replaced the majority of hereditary peers with appointees, which only increased the Prime Minister’s ability to put cronies into the upper chamber.","202.1",NA
"The House of Lords is now stuffed with party donors and fundraisers, ex-MPs, and favoured former employees.","202.1",NA
"Stuffed is the right word: the House of Lords is the second biggest legislature in the world, after the Chinese National People’s Congress.","202.1",NA
"The average cost of each peer is £115,000 per year.","303",NA
"A FAIR DEAL FOR ALL FOUR NATIONS","H",NA
"The public widely regards the United Kingdom’s current devolutionary system as fundamentally unfair, particularly to the English.","301",NA
"UKIP will put England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on the same footing by instituting a new English Parliament.","301",NA
"It will sit in the chamber vacated by the House of Lords, have its own First Minister, and its 375 members will be elected under the Additional Member system of proportional representation, one or more from each traditional county or large city and 125 top-up seats.","301",NA
"All four nations will have broadly similar devolved powers and none will have power over matters affecting the whole of the UK, such as foreign policy, defence of the realm, or constitutional matters.","301",NA
"A SMALLER HOUSE OF COMMONS","H",NA
"Our national parliament will be given two primary areas of responsibility: to act as an oversight body for the regional Parliaments and Assemblies, and to deal with all matters not devolved to them.","301",NA
"The size of the House of Commons will be halved to 325 directly elected members from across the four nations of the United Kingdom,","303",NA
"according to a system of proportional representation.","202.3",NA
"These changes will reduce the number of politicians eligible to sit in the legislature from 1475 to 700, a net reduction of 775.","303",NA
"THE CITIZEN’S INITIATIVE","H",NA
"If 10,000 people sign an approved parliamentary petition, the government must respond.","202.4",NA
"If over 100,000 people sign it, the petition must be debated in parliament.","202.4",NA
"However, this is not real democracy.","202.4",NA
"Responses to petitions are often cursory, sometimes derisory, and debates rarely take place in the House of Commons chamber, so are usually badly attended and easily dismissed.","202.4",NA
"We will pass legislation allowing citizens to influence our legislature directly, by giving them the power to initiate binding referenda on the issues of most importance to them.","202.4",NA
"Every two years, a national referendum will be held on the issues gaining the highest numbers of signatures on approved petitions.","202.4",NA
"The outcome of these referenda would be legally binding and included in the Queen’s Speech.","202.4",NA
"UKIP will lead the way in saving the Union","601.1",NA
"and ending friction in the current devolution settlement.","301",NA
"Our policies will end the need for tactical voting, which undermines democracy and freedom of political choice,","202.1",NA
"cut the cost and size of government,","303",NA
"and give people a real say in how they are governed.","202.4",NA
"UKIP is the real party for the people.","305.1",NA
"Keeping it Local","H",NA
"UKIP believes in localism, the kind that puts real power into the hands of the people.","301",NA
"Our councillors put party politics last, and believe in rolling up their sleeves and getting the job done.","305.1",NA
"Councillors exist to serve their communities, and one of the best ways to do that is by offering them a say in what happens on their doorstep, through the use of binding referenda. This will reinvigorate local politics, and shape our neighbourhoods to the benefit of everyone, not just powerful developers, or the most determined lobbyist.",NA,NA
"Peter Reeve MBE,",NA,NA
"Local Government Spokesman",NA,NA
"When it comes to key local issues such as out-of-town supermarkets, incinerators, and major housing developments, UKIP believes in holding binding local referenda.","202.4",NA
"Why should politicians and planning authorities have the final say?","202.4",NA
"UKIP is the only party to operate a ‘no whip’ system, so our councillors can always vote in the best interests of residents in their wards, because they are not bound by party politics.","202.1",NA
"We oppose the ‘cabinet’ system of local governance, which puts too much power in the hands of too few people.","202.1",NA
"We advocate a committee system, which brings more openness and transparency,","202.1",NA
"and facilitates cross-party collaborative working.","202.1",NA
"Collecting rubbish bins promptly and regularly, removing fly-tips, filling potholes, fixing broken or dim streetlights, providing enough parking, and keeping parks and libraries open: these services should be running smoothly before councillors even think about spending money on the next local vanity project.","303",NA
"UKIP believes in keeping Council Tax as low as possible.","408",NA
"We seek to cut excessive allowances for councillors, executive pay and bonuses,","303",NA

"build partnerships with neighbouring councils to reduce costs,","303",NA
"and abolish non-essential jobs and red tape.","303",NA
"UKIP will end the use of council procurement cards, which operate like credit cards, encouraging over-spending and waste.","303",NA
"Staff should stick within agreed budgets.","303",NA
"UKIP will review the many statutory duties placed on local government, to assess whether the cost burden on councils and taxpayers can be reduced.","303",NA
"Councils should only be doing what they do best, not what national government wants to wash its hands of.","303",NA
"UKIP: the party with local, common sense, cost-cutting policies for local government.","303",NA
